      <title>Friend&#39;s Homestead</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/friends-homestead/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two small scenes from a friend’s porch in mass this weekend. The star of the show here, apparently, are house plants. One seemingly leafless and stick-y, another with exaggerated leaves, clearly an out-of-towner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family was out for a few hours and I was home with the dogs, so for this one I actually sat and drew what I saw, as opposed to drawing from a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The barns across the street</title>

                &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/snow-barn/img/snow-barn-2-6-25.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pen and inkwash sketch of the posts from a porch in the foreground, a snowy road, and two barns across it covered in snow. one barn is tilted but still standing, trees in the background.&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/picture&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pen and inkwash drawing of a scene from our front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our house is placed super close to the road, as is the set of mostly unused barns across the street. They just reroofed the tilted one so it might have more hope than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting into a groove of creating these type of sketches. A new page layout is on the way…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
