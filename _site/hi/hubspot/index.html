				<p>Agency dashboard got an overhaul to include attribution and lead categorization. The design team was brought in to improve usability of new features.</p>

				<h4>Nautical HVAC Site </h4>
				<p>My agency didn‚Äôt offer branding, so I have lots of experience making sub-par logos shine. Charter, on the other hand had a fresh rebrand, which helped me tell their story.</p>

		<h1>Working in the Gift</h1>
		<h3>A method of exchange based on trust. </h3>
		
		<p>There are no formal contracts. Just a consensual willingness to trust. Don‚Äôt worry&mdash;we‚Äôll still have time lines, deliverables, and super-fun strategy sessions. The websites and logos aren‚Äôt free and value-less. They have value. What precisely that value is&mdash;is up to you.</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">The time is ripe for alternatives. I know. It feels weird. It‚Äôs my way of taking a step toward a world I want to live in. A world with more personal weight tied to every transaction.</span></p>
		<p>I'm moved and inspired by a local <a href="https://www.brushbrookcommunityfarm.org/" target="blank" class="external">bakery/farm</a> trying it. They pulled their sourdough bread off the shelves and now give hundreds of loaves away every weekend. They make enough money to meet their needs and, more importantly, are making waves.</p>
		<p>I‚Äôve had the honor of working on four projects so far in the Gift. We‚Äôve exchanged branding and websites for cash, handmade beds, carved signs, beer, and bread. </p>
