<h2>Benefits</h2>
<!-- To do this, we minimize meetings. We will have a kickoff call, but all remaining back-and-forths are through a task management tool. To make use of the short timeline, we offer as many revisions as we can fit in the week. -->
<!-- (nicely designed) -->
  <ul>
    <h4><li>unlimited revisions within the week </li></h4>
    <h4><li>no meetings -- async communication</li></h4>
    <h4><li>no arduous process -- keep it simple</li></h4>
    <h4><li>100% custom logo not made by a robot</li></h4>
  </ul>
<h2>This only works if we follow a tight process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Kickoff</strong>: our and only meeting where we align on your vision and needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Draft</strong>: I share 2-3 rough concepts with you. You pick one.</li>
    <li><strong>Refine</strong>: I go back to nip and tuck, button up, and dial in your new logo. Here, we'll do up to 3 rounds.
    <li><strong>Deliver</strong>: I email you the logo, colors, and fonts you need for web and print.</li>
</ol>
<h2>It’s not for everyone</h2>
<p>Don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p>The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it's not for all of us.</p>
<p><i>Logo in-a-week</i> reinvents the branding process by optimizing for speed while keeping the quality as high as humanly possible.</p>
<p>It prevents sprawl, prevents scope creep, and laser-focuses the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Meetings, revisions, corralling everyone’s input. This can be arduous because you want to do it right for this mark will represent your company or org maybe for decades.</p>
<h2>It’s for...</h2>
<p>those who want a handmade logo—<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. 👋🏻 I promise not to subcontract an AI.</p>
<p>And at the end of the week, your custom logo will be sent in all the formats you need.</p>
<p>It's also only for Vermonters at the moment. It's where I live and my method of starting small.</p>
<p>You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>This service follows the gift-economy model.</p>
<p>Meaning I'm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.</p>
<p>I think this is really important right now because assigning a dollar amount to every single thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships.</p>
<p>I'm doing this as an experiment to see if I can meet some cool people, exchange a service.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why not 2 weeks?</h3>
<p>I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.</p>
<p>It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.</p>
<p>And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.</p>
<p>And make sure it can be good for creative things.</p>
<h3>More to come....</h3>
