<h2>This service might be for you, if...</h2>
<ol>
<li>You live in Vermont.</li>
<li>You’re open to working in the Gift economy.</li>
<li>You’re ready, or can be soon, to get a new logo.</li>
</ol>
<!-- those who want a handmade logo—<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. 👋🏻 I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

It’s also only for Vermonters at the moment. It’s where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a  that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...
 -->
<h3>No, it’s not for everyone.</h3>
<p>The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it’s not for all of us.</p>
<p><i>Logo in-a-week</i> argues that constraint prevents sprawl and scope-creep. And laser focuses the decision making process.</p>
<p>Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone’s input can be arduous.</p>
<p>Get it done quick so you can take a breather.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>This service follows the gift-economy model.</p>
<p>Meaning, I’m prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or in some other way.</p>
<p>I think this completely radical idea is important right now. Commerce-as-usual is the air we breathe. It reinforces the idea that every task should be monetized and counted. This tends to minimize relationships.</p>
<p>This service is an experiment toward pro-relationship business.</p>
<p>I’ve used this model for many projects and I’m excited to expand it.</p>
<p>I wrote more about <a href="/blog/gift/">freelancing in the gift here</a>.</p>
