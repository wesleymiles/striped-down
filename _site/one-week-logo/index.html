<h2>This service might be for you, if...</h2>
  <ul class="checks">
    <li>You’re open to working in the gift economy.</li>
    <li>You’re ready, or can be soon, to get a new logo.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>No, it’s not for everyone.</h3>
<p>The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it’s not for all of us.</p>
<p><i>Logo in-a-week</i> argues that constraint prevents sprawl and scope-creep. And laser focuses the decision making process.</p>
<p>Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone’s input can be arduous.</p>
<p>Get it done quick so you can take a breather.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>This service follows the gift economy model.</p>
<p>Meaning, I’m prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or in some other way.</p>
<p>I think this completely radical idea is important right now. Commerce-as-usual is the air we breathe. It reinforces the idea that every task should be monetized and counted. This tends to minimize relationships and cease them at moment of transaction.</p>
<p>This service is an experiment toward pro-relationship business.</p>
<p>I’ve used this model for many projects and I’m excited to expand it.</p>
<p>I wrote more about <a href="/blog/gift/">freelancing in the gift here</a>.</p>
<h2>Need proof that branding works?</h2>
<p>I had the pleasure of working with this branding companies logos before. They track the impact of their logos in terms of client revenue. See the <a href="https://www.kickcharge.com/portfolio/client-stats/" class="external" >GIGANTIC percentage increases</a> on fifty rebrands.</p>

<h2>Here’s how it works</h2>
  <ol class="cols">
    <li>
      <h4>Kickoff</h4> 
      We we align on your vision and needs at our one and only meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Draft</h4> 
      I share 2-3 rough concepts with you. You pick one.
    </li>
    <li><h4>Refine</h4> 
      I go back to dial in your new logo. Repeat as many as we can fit.</li>
    <li>
      <h4>Deliver</h4> 
      I email you the logo, colors, and fonts -- all you need for web and print.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
  <details>
    <summary> Why not 2 weeks? </summary>
    <div>
<p>I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.</p>
<p>It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.</p>
<p>And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.
</div></p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary >Why you? </summary>
    <div>
<p>In the last 10 years, i helped 322 orgs create a positive, memorable impression. Half a dozen have taken a jump into the gift-world with me.</p>
<p>Behind this idea is an urge to help small local orgs succeed.</p>
<p>I want to give that old pizza shop getting cornered by Chili’s and Texas Roadhouse a fighting chance.</p>
<p>I aim to help you expand your reach by creating a crunchy promise your potential customers can sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Lastly, taste. This is a real reason why people hire designers. I know what good design looks like and can help channel your vision into something pleasing.
</div></p>

  <details>
    <summary> Why are logos magic?</summary>
    <div>
<p>They have the power to communicate your values, philosophy, reputation, and what customers can expect by using succinct imagery.</p>
<p>Your logo is the core of your brand.</p>
<p>Branding is the whole thing - the combination of messaging and visuals you consistently use.</p>
<p>With this service, it’s up to <i>you</i> to apply and express the logo in ways that resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>It’s also up to you to back up the promise of a logo with action.
</div></p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary> If logos are so magic, why are we rushing this?</summary>
    <div>
<p>Very astute question, reader.</p>
<p>This is the crux of my offering.</p>
<p>I believe logos matter a lot, but I also believe people tend to waste time on them. Let’s meet in the middle and see if we can’t get you a top-notch logo, fast.
