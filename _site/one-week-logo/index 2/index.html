<h2>It‚Äôs not for everyone</h2>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong.</p>
<p>The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it's not for all of us.</p>
<p><i>Logo in-a-week</i> reinvents the logo creation process by optimizing for speed while keeping the quality as high as humanly possible.</p>
<p>The constraint prevents sprawl, prevents scope creep, and laser-focuses the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone‚Äôs input can be arduous. It's all in the name of doing it right, for this mark will represent your organization for hopefully decades.</p>
<h2>It is for...</h2>
<p>those who want a handmade logo‚Äî<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. üëãüèª I promise not to subcontract an AI.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also only for Vermonters at the moment. It‚Äôs where I live and my method of starting small.</p>
<p>You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>This service follows the gift-economy model.</p>
<p>Meaning I‚Äôm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.</p>
<p>I think this is important right now. Assigning a dollar amount to every thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships. This is a pro-relationship business.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve used this model for many projects and I‚Äôm excited to expand it</p>

  <ol>

</ol>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why not 2 weeks?</h3>
<p>I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.</p>
<p>It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.</p>
<p>And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.</p>
<p>And make sure it can be good for creative things.</p>
<h3>Why you?</h3>

<h2>Reminder: logos are magic</h2>
<p>They have the power to communicate your values, philosophy, reputation, and what customers can expect by using succinct imagery.</p>
<p>Branding is the whole thing - the combination of messaging and visuals you consistently use.</p>
<p>Your logo is the core of your brand.</p>
<p>With this service, it‚Äôs up to <i>you</i> to apply and express the logo in ways that resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>It's also your responsibility as an org to back it up with action.</p>
<p>The logo is the promise that you will.</p>

  <h2>Schedule a quick zoom call to see if this service is right for you</h2>
If it‚Äôs a fit, I‚Äôll send you a form. Take your time to fill it out with your vision and goals for the logo.
<p>Then we‚Äôll have one call and as many revisions as we can fit in a week.</p>
<p>At the end of the week you'll have your new logo.</p>
