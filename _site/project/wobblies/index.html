        <p>Inspired and sourced from the graphic novel: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384897.Wobblies_A_Graphic_History_of_the_Industrial_Workers_of_the_World">Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World</a>, which features a different comic artist for each subject/era, and also by <a href="https://colly.com">colly.com</a>'s timeline, this page tells the story from each of the famous labor union's prominent figures.</p>
        <p>What struck me was each artist's unique tribute to the legendary fighters. To not let them drip from my mind sieve, I snapped photos as a way to help remember their stories, before returning the book to library. </p>
