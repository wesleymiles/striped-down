<p>hometown hero flexing his charm with a borderline joke to the guys at the bar, and they slap their knees like they’ve not heard it before.
 thirty-five years old wearing his badge, nickname for life on the shoulder of his bomber that he wears as the coach of the high school team.
 he lights his cigarette
 and says, &quot;man these things will kill me someday&quot; raises his glass and says, &quot;here’s to hoping&quot;  hometown hero flexing his arm with a five-yard pass to the end of the bar he says, &quot;I’ll be right back I’m just gonna go grab another pack.&quot;  walks one block to the all-night station and steps into a situation. there’s a man with a gun pointed at the nervous clerk.    and before he could think, he was tackling the gunman who hit his head and was knocked unconscious.    the clerk relieved said, &quot;oh my god you’re a hero man and you should stick around ’til the cops get here, maybe you’ll make the morning news.&quot;  but the hometown hero rose to hit feet, tossed him the gun and said, &quot;thanks, but I’ve gotta run I’ll take a pack of camel lights and be on my way.&quot;    he stepped outside the door, heard the sirens in the distance lit his cigarette and said, &quot;man these things will kill me someday&quot; exhaled smoke and said, “here’s to hoping”</p>
