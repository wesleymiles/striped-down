it's so hard to wake up

<p>my baby sleeps like she’s on ether
she pleasantly pains the chains and leather
‘cause she’s checkin’ out the guys, gazin’ at the stars
suffocatin’ fireflies in a jar, twinklin’
those cuckoo birds and killer bees
are what have brought me to my knees</p>
<p>'cause i’ve been lapped by my losing streak
and i’m going for the gold
yeah!</p>
<p>one asked, “can you spare some cotter me brother?”
i broke his neck and stole his needles
‘cause i got my mind on my money, money on my mind
love’s like a gag in your grab bag, lover
i’m your spectator sport-o, blockin’ your view
won’t buy your right to life 'cause baby i’m a jew
sucker!</p>
<p>'cause if you’re packing heat for christ
then i’m kicking ass for god</p>
<p>who wears the crown
who wears the crown
who wears the crown
is going, yeah he’s going
down</p>
<p>stupidest boy</p>
<pre><code>I know you when I'm sleeping
I know things deep inside of me

The excitement that I swallow
I swallow things that I can't see

I know you're right behind me
But I'm too dumb to turn around

I wake with my left arm numb
Am I the stupidest boy in town
(the stupidest boy in town)

Can you see my mouth open wide
Lopsided and confused

The dead weight of my left arm
And already sold that you will refuse

Substance dream mechanical failure
My little lost boy trying to sound

I wake with my left arm numb
Am I the stupidest boy in town

Pain is good if I had understood
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide
Numbness disappears when you are near
Nicky, take me for a ride

Your daddy is smiling at me
White horses flowing through his veins

Impossible eyes, forgotten future
And enough angst-ridden guilt to go insane

A walk together, a walk that hurt
A road I didn't know and soon forgot

I wake with my left arm numb
He's not with you, will you be with me

Pain is good if I had understood
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide
Numbness disappears when you are near
Nicky, take me for a ride

Nicky you touched me


i wish you were a girl
</code></pre>
<p>i wish you were a girl
a girl who is soft as silk
but silky from the inside out</p>
<p>don’t get me wrong, i like you anyway
i’ll be with you today
you can show me your way</p>
<p>'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don’t be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward</p>
<p>i wish you were a girl
but i’m not sorry that you’re not
'cause i’m still flattered</p>
<p>don’t get me wrong
but everything’s so new
'cause i’m not scared for some reason
'cause i got naked with you</p>
<p>'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don’t be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward</p>
<p>'cause if you were a girl (oh)
nothing would seem to matter
('cause) if you were a girl (oh)
i wouldn’t really care</p>
<p>i wish you were a girl
i hate what i just said
i wish you were a girl
for some reason, i don’t know,
but someone told me to</p>
<p>'cause i feel green
if you know what i mean
don’t be so nice to me
'cause i feel awkward</p>
<p>'cause if you were a girl (oh)
nothing would seem to matter
('cause) if you were a girl (oh)
i wouldn’t really care
if you were a girl (oh)
come on over and see me
if you were a girl (ooh)</p>
<p>i’m sinning for another answer
i’m sinning for my right to care
i’m laughing but it’s not so funny
so take me far away from here</p>
<p>i wish you were a girl
i wish you
i wish you were a girl
i wish you
i wish you were</p>

<p>i wish i didn’t grow up
in the town that i grew up in
kept me silent
kept me stupid
never fought back
never fought back</p>
<p>where were my friends
to keep me up, down
that’s all it took to keep me on the ground
rubbing mud in my eyes
rubbing mud in my eyes</p>
<p>don’t want to live today
was taught to tell
walk away not fight
i wish to me
muhammad ali</p>
<p>good morning sun
good morning light
each day it’s nice to see that you’ve come back
to give us all
give us all
another chance</p>
<p>installing pride to make a glory ride
i want to love you
but i must save my hide
and these fists that hang beside my side
i realize what i gotta do
na-nanny-boo-boo
nanny-nanny-boo-boo</p>
<p>i’m feeling better today
i kicked his ass
it wasn’t hard
i beat him down
it wasn’t hard
this vibrate sound
adrenaline</p>
<p>what will mother say?
blackened both his eyes
busted but with twice the pride</p>
<p>i was mad 'cause i was sad
now there’s a smile on my face
knuckles hurt he’s in the dirt
feels like i’m taking a girl to second base (second base)
this disrespect is what is wrecked
just like the nose on that jerk’s face
i earned my place</p>
<p>shaking mad
oh so glad
sweet, sweet gift
i never had</p>
<p>girl sun</p>
<pre><code>heavy water
that falls all over me
i asked her
then i fell asleep

i don't believe i asked her
no i don't believe i did
i believe i fell asleep
tonight

stop the pilot
the pilot's flown so high
so high i'll never come back down
so i closed my eyes

i do not trust in my conscience
and i don't believe in wine
i believe you've made your point to me
your point to me

is the girl sun and her distant places
girl sun and her fickle faces
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now you're gone

i asked for heaven
then she asked me for time
so i gave her mine
yeah i gave her mine

i do not trust in science
and i don't believe in god
i believe you've made your point to me
your point to me

is the girl sun and her distant places
girl sun and her fickle faces
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now
you're a girl sun who lights my way
girl sun to whom i pray
you're so bright that i closed my eyes so long
that now, that...

ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba-a-ah ba ba ba ba-a

the sun seems so far away
the sun stings my eyes
she my girl sun
a sting that hurt my eyes
i didn't realize that i closed my eyes so long

that now you're gone
