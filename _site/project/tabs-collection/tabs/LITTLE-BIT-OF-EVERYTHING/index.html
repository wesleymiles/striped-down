    <p>Dawes - A little bit of everything</p>
<p>capo 5th
Em/G 322010</p>
<p>C                     F                 C
With his back against the san frisco traffic
Em/G                                      C
On the bridges side that faces towards the jail
Am           G                  F
Setting out to join a demographic,
C                 F                  C
He hoists his first leg up over the rail.</p>
<p>And a phone call is made,
Police cars show up quickly.
The sergeant slams his passenger door.
He says, Hey son why dont you talk through this with me,
Just tell me what youre doing it for.</p>
<p>Am                       C
Oh, its a little bit of everything,
Am
Its the mountains,
Em/G
Its the fog,
Am                    C
Its the news at six oclock,
G
Its the death of my first dog,
C                     F
Its the angels up above me,
C                         Am
Its the song that they dont sing,
Em/G         G             C
Its a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>An older man stands in a buffet line,
He is smiling and holding out his plate,
And the further he looks back into his timeline,
That hard road always had led him to today,
And making up for when his bright future had left him,
Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,
And letting everything out once, His server asks him,
Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?</p>
<p>I want a little bit of everything,
The biscuits and the beans,
Whatever helps me to forget about
The things that brought me to my knees,
So pile on those mashed potatoes,
And an extra chicken wing,
Im having a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,
Her man says, Baby, can I make an observation?
You dont seem to be having any fun at all.
She said, You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,
And rest assured that this is making me feel good,
I think that love is so much easier than you realize,
If you can give yourself to someone,
Then you should.</p>
<p>Cause its a little bit of everything,
The way you choke, the way you ache,
It is waking up before you,
So I can watch you as you wake.
So in the day in late September,
Its not some stupid little ring,
Im giving a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>Oh, its a little bit of everything,
Its the matador and the bull,
Its the suggested daily dosage,
It is the red moon when its full.
All these psychics and these doctors,
Theyre all right and theyre all wrong,
Its like trying to make out every word,
When they should simply hum along,
Its not some message written in the dark,
Or some truth that no ones seen,
Its a little bit of everything.</p>
