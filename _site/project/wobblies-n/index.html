        <h1>Wobblies timeline</h1>
        <p>Inspired and sourced from the graphic novel: Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World, featuring a different comic artist for each subject/era. And <a href="https://colly.com">colly.com</a>, who's timeline I've always admired.</p>
        <p>What struck me was the way that each artists paid tribute to whatever prominent figure they were drawing. Before returning the book to library i snapped photos as a way to help remember their stories</p>
