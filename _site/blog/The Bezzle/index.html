<p>Cataloging a list of things I learned and later looked up because of the book.</p>

<p>This was my second Doctorow work.</p>
<p>The first, For the Win (2010), was a lesson in labor rights and exploitation in the digital age. It sat upon  fiction about video game “gold farmers&quot;—low-wage workers from developing countries, who were hired to play games to earn currency for wealthier players.</p>
<p>This one followed a similar format. The underlying non-fiction piece is about profit-prisons and frauds. The fiction follows a noir-style accountant going up against a capitalist system who’s continues to more cleverly extract money from the rest of us.</p>
<h3>Scams</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ponzi scheme</strong>: use new investors' money to pay returns to earlier ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pyramid scheme</strong>: rely on recruiting new members, with payouts depending on expanding levels of recruits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downline</strong>: People below you in the recruitment or sales chain. So, if you recruit three people into the program, those three are part of your downline.</li>
<li><strong>Upline</strong>: People above you who recruited you into the system. Your sales contribute to the earnings of everyone higher up in the hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Junk fees</strong>: hidden or unexpected charges added to the cost of a product or service, often without clear explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The bezzle</strong>: The period of the con has started and the future seems bright and prosperous to those who have invested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private equity</strong>: a form of investment where funds are directly invested into private companies, or where investors buy out public companies to take them private. They say and can fix companies, they can also hurt them if they focus only on making money quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venture Capital</strong>: a type of private equity in early-stage investments in startups with high growth potential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cali’s private prisons</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>80s: overcrowding begins due to tough-on-crime policies</li>
<li>90s: private prisons introduced to make more space for inmates. Even harsher crime policy cranks up the numbers more</li>
<li>2000s: Prisons at 200% capacity. Lawsuits filed about inhumane conditions and inadequate healthcare for inmates.</li>
<li>2010s: Supreme Court orders Cali to reduce, but their citizens aren’t warm to the idea of roaming ex-inmates, so the state does little.</li>
<li>2023: They’re down to only 126% capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financiers, and those within that world, end up being more cruel to the inmates than the prison guards. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance, making dehumanization easier.</li>
<li>Different incentives. Financiers are rewarded for squeezing maximum value out of every transaction, even if it harms the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2>California’s avoidance in dealing with terrible conditions.</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>The hundreds? Of studies done during the psychedelic boom showing significant improvement of ___. Before the propaganda machine started making it scary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cali</h3>
<ul>
<li>History of nazis in the sherif LA</li>
<li>And their “998” tattoos</li>
<li><strong>Catalina Island</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>William Wrigley Jr.</strong>, the chewing gum magnate, bought it in 1919
<ul>
<li>His money came the typical way; shrewdness, which lead him to buy up 95% of the world’s chicle tree forests. Anyone would now need to go through him to make gum.</li>
<li>He bought the Chicago Cubs and they went there for spring training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DDT filled</strong>: One of the deepest channels off any coast. Sits there is tens of thousands of barrels of the toxic pesticide. Someday they will all leak and kill all life around it. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/">Sweet expose</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critique</h3>
<p>The characters came off as a little flat. I cannot comprehend how the main character Marty displayed no remorse for being solely responsible for putting his friend in prison. At no point did he offer an apology or even narrate to us how it was actually his fault.</p>
