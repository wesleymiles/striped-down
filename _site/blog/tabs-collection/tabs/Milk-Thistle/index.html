    <p>Milk Thistle - Conor Oberst (and the Mystic Valley Band)</p>
<p>CAPO: 4th Fret</p>
<p>Intro: C  Bm
C D G
C D Em
C  D</p>
<p>C              Bm
Milk thistle, milk thistle,
C      D    G
Let me down slow,
C       D    Em
Help me go slow,
C          D
I've been carryin' on,
C            G
I'm not scared of nothin',
C          G
I'll go pound for pound,
C         G
I keep death on my mind,
C       D
Like a heavy crown.
C     D
If I go to heaven,
C         D
I'll be bored as hell,
C       D
Like a little baby,
Am             G
At the bottom of a well.</p>
<p>(At the end of a verse hammer on to the 3rd fret of the A string – so when you get to
you play the bass string (E:-3-) then hammer on (A:-2h3-) then play the bass string again
it’s really simple and obvious when you listen to the song.)</p>
<p>C           Bm
Fair child, fair child,
C   D       G
How are you man?
C      D    Em
Did you fix that storefront?
C           D
Did you start that band?
C          G
Don't be scared of nothin',
C         G
You go pound for pound,
C           G
You'll bring peace to midnight,
C        D
Like a spotted owl.
C          D
I'll be rootin' for you,
C        D
Like my favourite team,
C      D
If somebody sweats you,
Am             G
You just point 'em out to me.</p>
<p>(Same hammering on as in the first verse)</p>
<p>(This next bit, along with most of the C Em Am parts is just the A string (A: -3-2-0- ))</p>
<p>C Em
Am
All the sights and sounds,
B11
This little world's too crowded now,
C**     D          G (Hammering as usual)
And there's only one way out.
C Em
Am
An elevator ride,
B11
Through the tunnel towards the light,
C**   D        G (Hammering)
And I’m nowhere bound,
C   Em  D
Keep going up and down,
C  Em  G (B)
Up and down.</p>
<p>C          Bm
Newspaper, newspaper
C     D  G
Can't take no more,
C  D    Em
You're here every morning,
C       D
Waitin' at my door.
C          G
I'm just tryin' to kiss you,
C       G
And you stab my eyes,
C        G
Make me blue forever,
C      D
Like an Island sky.
C        D
And I'm not pretending,
C      D
That it's all okay,
C        D
Just let me have my coffee,
Am              G (Hammering)
Before you take away the day.</p>
<p>C        Bm
Lazarus, Lazarus,
C      D     G
Why all the tears?
C   D    Em
Did your faithful chauffer
C         D
Just disappear?
C          G
What a lonesome feeling,
C           G
To be just waitin' round,
C            G
Like some washed up actress,
C      D
In a Tinseltown.
C        D
But for the record,
C          D
I'd come pick you up,
C        D
We'll head for the ocean,
Am                G (Hammering)
Just say when you've had enough.</p>
<p>C Em
Am
All the light and sound,
B11
This little world's too fragile now,
C**    D         G (Hammering)
And there's only one way out.
C Em
Am
But if you let me slide,
B11
I'll do my best to make things right,
C**  D        G (Hammering)
And I’m nowhere bound,
C  Em   D
Keep going up and down,
C  Em   G
Up and down.</p>
<p>C             Bm
Milk thistle, milk thistle,
C   D      G
Let me down slow,
C     D      Em
Just help me go slow,
C         D
I've been hurrying on.
C          G
I was poised for greatness,
C         G
I was down and out
C            G
I keep death at my heels
C       D
Like a basset hound
C       D
If I go to heaven,
C        D
I'll be bored as hell,
C        D
Like a crying baby,
Am            G (No hammering)
At the bottom of a well.</p>
<p>Notes:
B11 - I’m not sure the real chord name so I’ll tab it out instead.</p>
<p>e|-0-
B|-0-
G|-2-
D|-1-
A|-2-
E|---</p>
<p>C** - In the live version I have on video at this point after a brief strum he plays:</p>
<p>e|-------------|
B|-------------|
G|-0h2p0-------|
D|-------0h2p0-|
A|-------------|
E|-------------|</p>
