West Valley mum and  Family
with seven hungry mouth to feet
D                                           F#m
that’s how she leraned to raise my sister and me
D                      F#m
voted nixon in the seventies</p>
<p>A                    D

A                   D
it’ll all work out</p>
<p>my mother was the youngest child
no college education
wasn’t ever her style but
she knew just how to make a quarterback smile</p>
<p>it’ would all work out
it’ll all work out</p>
<p>my father loved us right
stayed up at night trying to keep the checkbook tighter
than a ducks ass going down on waterslide
ohh i know he tried
became a victim of the mortgage spikes
collections calling every night since 1999
in ten more years you  think the interest rates decline</p>
<p>it’ ll all work out
it’ll all work out
it’ll all work out</p>
<p>the say go to college get you knowledge straighten up
with inherit desperation and the way it sounded
like you bet on it and now its seems … we’re down
thank you dad I love you and I’ll  make you proud
I’m sorry I didn’t take the road you laid down</p>
<p>it’ ll all work out
it’ll all work out
it’ ll all work out</p>
<p>is that you’re litter in the middle of the park
i must have been out of town for quite a little while
the stitches in youre arm must have healed by now
fuck that plummer if youre heat is still out
and don’t be scared I know you can still throw down</p>
<p>it’ ll all work out
it’ll all work out
it’ ll all work out</p>
<p>I don’t feel a speck of hate
really now I’m trying to get my story straight
when you called me from your car
when you were on your way with friend from san francisco
that you told me was gay, guess he was a closet straight</p>
<p>get it all out now</p>
