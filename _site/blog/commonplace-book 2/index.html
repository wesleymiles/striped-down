<p>My family and I care for a 800 square feet garden in San Francisco‚Äôs Mission District. Planning started in 2015 and we finally planted in January 2017. The process involved tearing up concrete, pouring a new sidewalk, hauling in clean soil, and patiently waiting for the wet season to plant.

    I've been an admirer of the Arlington, MA design firm <a href="https://goinvo.com">GoInvo</a> since I lived nearby. They're a small team who's narrowed their focus on one industry: healthcare, and they're dedicated to open source design. Anywho, they've put together a decent list of <a href="https://running.goinvo.com/design">design resources</a> within their team wiki.
