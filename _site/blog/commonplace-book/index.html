<ul>
<li>This book, Death by meetings, is recommended:
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you want your meetings to be more effective, and ultimate contribute to the bottom line of your business, then introduce healthy conflict within a light weight structure. Let the attendees emotion be the driving energy behind good decisions and business success.”</li>
<li>“I usually practice out loud on and off for a day or two before hand. Once I’m in the meeting I will be freer to speak because as I interact, it will just flow, and I will be able to a adjust as I go, because I’ve heard how it comes across in my practice times.”</li>
<li>“Once you have spoken at meetings, leading a conversation actually becomes easy, and in fact, too easy.”</li>

<p>Watched glass onion movie:</p>
<p>Nice story of the disruptor-elite class and their shackles to their world that are only breakable when they personally witness the systems falling apart.</p>
<p>Most poignant part: when the black woman started breaking the glass sculptures, everyone was OK with it. some even cheered her on. most elite were fine with it. then the lower elite class started breaking them and had fun and the leader didn’t care. then the woman took it further and the lowers stopped, aghast. the breaking point was the mona lisa. not sure what it signified, but it was the last sacred thing to these people.</p>
