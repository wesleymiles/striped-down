    Been digging deep into observational, documentary, street photography. It took me a while to figure out the aesthetic I was after. I landed on:
<p><em>Photos of built environments; quiet shadows on buildings, mundane and overlooked subjects, architectural details, the interplay of light and shadow emphasizing abstraction and geometry, and mood over human presence.</em></p>

    <p>We need to confront honestly the issue of scale. Bigness has a charm and a drama that are seductive, especially to politicians and financiers; but bigness promotes greed, indifference, and damage, and often bigness is not necessary. You may need a large corporation to run an airline or to manufacture cars, but you don't need a large corporation to raise a chicken or a hog. You don't need a large corporation to process local food or local timber and market it locally.</p>

<ul>
<li>This book, Death by meetings, is recommended:
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you want your meetings to be more effective, and ultimate contribute to the bottom line of your business, then introduce healthy conflict within a light weight structure. Let the attendees emotion be the driving energy behind good decisions and business success.‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúI usually practice out loud on and off for a day or two before hand. Once I‚Äôm in the meeting I will be freer to speak because as I interact, it will just flow, and I will be able to a adjust as I go, because I‚Äôve heard how it comes across in my practice times.‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúOnce you have spoken at meetings, leading a conversation actually becomes easy, and in fact, too easy.‚Äù</li>

<p>Watched glass onion movie:</p>
<p>Nice story of the disruptor-elite class and their shackles to their world that are only breakable when they personally witness the systems falling apart.</p>
<p>Most poignant part: when the black woman started breaking the glass sculptures, everyone was OK with it. some even cheered her on. most elite were fine with it. then the lower elite class started breaking them and had fun and the leader didn‚Äôt care. then the woman took it further and the lowers stopped, aghast. the breaking point was the mona lisa. not sure what it signified, but it was the last sacred thing to these people.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been an admirer of the Arlington, MA design firm <a href="https://goinvo.com">GoInvo</a> since I lived nearby. They‚Äôre a small team who‚Äôs narrowed their focus on one industry: healthcare, and they‚Äôre dedicated to open source design. Anywho, they‚Äôve put together a decent list of <a href="https://running.goinvo.com/design">design resources</a> within their team wiki.</p>
