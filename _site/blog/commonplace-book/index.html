<p>The Core Principles of Radical Honesty</p>
<ol>
<li>Lying is the primary cause of suffering</li>
<li>Living honestly is the antidote to lying and the root of its power is in distinguishing <em>noticing</em> from <em>thinking</em>. You can only <em>notice</em> in the moment. And you can only notice three categories of things: sensations, thoughts, and your external surroundings.</li>
<li>Sharing honestly what you notice frees you from the suffering caused by attachment to lying, withholding, phoniness, and ideals.</li>
<li>Sharing honestly what you notice also deepens love, connection, understanding and forgiveness (eventually).</li>
<li>Radical Honesty is a living, walking, talking out-loud meditation that moves you from reactivity to being a creator of your own life.</li>

<p>Really enjoying the continuing conversation between Adam Wilson and Sam Bliss, kicked off in a series called “The Anarchist and the Animist” <a href="https://peasantryschool.substack.com/p/radical-hospitality">Adam’s newsletter</a> in 2022. The podcast <a href="https://www.micaylajean.com/the-podcast">Finding Wilder</a> had them both on discussing the gift economy where the two “have a few stories worth telling about the magic that happens when food is turned back into a gift.”</p>
<p>My notes on the pod:</p>
<p>Alternative Terms for “Gift Economy”</p>
<ul>
<li>Reckless Generosity: A proactive and unconditional giving without calculation of return.</li>
<li>Voluntary Impoverishment: The inverse of above. Of course no one likes how that feels.</li>
<li>Radical Hospitality: The generous and welcoming nature of the natural world. Adam’s “translation of what the landscaping is doing”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Paradox of Open Giving: There’s an observation that when one adopts a stance of complete generosity—“people have free reign to take what they want from me”—the expected outcome of being depleted does not happen.</p>
<p>The Prerequisite of Worthiness for Receiving: To be able to accept profound gifts from others—especially those that cannot be repaid—a person must possess a “multitude of worthiness.”</p>
<p>The story of “Old Sally,” who, after injuring her leg, had her cows milked by neighbors for six weeks. This illustrates a community’s response to a member deemed worthy of such a non-transactional gift.</p>
<p>The Call to Community: A central theme is a deep “longing for community” and belonging. This longing is framed not as a response to an absence, but as a recognition of the potential for community that is “around us everywhere.” The core action is to work “against the forces that will make us all strangers to one another.”</p>
<p>Guidance from the “Non-Human”: There is a spiritual or ecological dimension suggesting that “the non-humans are asking us is to focus on how we treat each others as humans.” This also involves embracing a “non-professional way” of doing things, valuing authentic human connection over polished expertise.</p>

    <p>We need to confront honestly the issue of scale. Bigness has a charm and a drama that are seductive, especially to politicians and financiers; but bigness promotes greed, indifference, and damage, and often bigness is not necessary. You may need a large corporation to run an airline or to manufacture cars, but you don't need a large corporation to raise a chicken or a hog. You don't need a large corporation to process local food or local timber and market it locally.</p>

<ul>
<li>This book, Death by meetings, is recommended:
<ul>
<li>&quot;If you want your meetings to be more effective, and ultimate contribute to the bottom line of your business, then introduce healthy conflict within a light weight structure. Let the attendees emotion be the driving energy behind good decisions and business success.”</li>
<li>“I usually practice out loud on and off for a day or two before hand. Once I’m in the meeting I will be freer to speak because as I interact, it will just flow, and I will be able to a adjust as I go, because I’ve heard how it comes across in my practice times.”</li>
<li>“Once you have spoken at meetings, leading a conversation actually becomes easy, and in fact, too easy.”</li>

<p>Watched glass onion movie:</p>
<p>Nice story of the disruptor-elite class and their shackles to their world that are only breakable when they personally witness the systems falling apart.</p>
<p>Most poignant part: when the black woman started breaking the glass sculptures, everyone was OK with it. some even cheered her on. most elite were fine with it. then the lower elite class started breaking them and had fun and the leader didn’t care. then the woman took it further and the lowers stopped, aghast. the breaking point was the mona lisa. not sure what it signified, but it was the last sacred thing to these people.</p>

<p>It was like her body was an ocean, and these feelings would always come and go like the tides. The task was not to let herself be pulled away by one of the currents. The task was to accept that her insides would feel violent and tumultuous at times, and to be okay with that.”

<p>My family and I care for a 800 square feet garden in San Francisco’s Mission District. Planning started in 2015 and we finally planted in January 2017. The process involved tearing up concrete, pouring a new sidewalk, hauling in clean soil, and patiently waiting for the wet season to plant.

        <p>We were told that “everything’s on streaming now”. We thought we’d have access to 120 years of cinema history. Instead, we have access only to the content that can be readily and easily monetised, trapped in garish and unreliable platforms.

They’re a small team who’s narrowed their focus on one industry: healthcare, and they’re dedicated to open source design. Anywho, they’ve put together a decent list of <a href="https://running.goinvo.com/design">design resources</a> within their team wiki.</p>
