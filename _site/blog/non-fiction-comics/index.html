<p>Originally this was a series of comic books published first in english in 1972. I stumbled on it while visiting a friend, going through a stack of their dad’s old radical comics, and read the whole thing aggressively. When done, I sat there stunned, wondering what I just experienced.</p>
<p>It’s a model for the non-fiction, memoir graphic novel genre.</p>
<p>I was transported before and after the bombing of Hiroshima. And saw it through the innocent eyes of a six-year-old boy. From the point of view of Gen, son of a dissenter and rejector of the pro-war propaganda. Because of this the family are ostracized and deprived of community, save for a Korean family who receives much discrimination.</p>
<p>The propaganda piece was fascinating to me. How a culture was created where everyone in society contributes to the war effort to the point where families guard rice with their lives. For those labeled as traitors, as Gen’s family was, they no longer can ask any friends for extra food else the friend will be considered helping a traitor. Dissenting means starving. Gen’s older brother tries to restore his families honor by joining the army.</p>
<p>The story is told matter of factly with no sense of preachiness.</p>
<p>The illustrations and drawing are fairly simple compared to others I’ve read, but I still found them captivating. They create a world thats easy to sink into where the panels fade away and it’s just you and the story.</p>

A very thick graphic novel about buying and selling wishes. coming soon
<!-- 

a moving-to-tears, beautiful, mega-thick comic 🥹 👏



learned a bunch from the emotional 20 minute read of Don Brown's The Great American Dust Bowl.

for not having many words, at 80 pages with huge panels, the sources section is immense. think this is due to footnoting many actual quotes into the story.
