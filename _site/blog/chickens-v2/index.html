<h1>Chickens, part 2</h1>
<p>Chipping away at the coop, one month in.</p>
</section>

<h2>More wood</h2>
<p>The cedar was great, but it felt thick at 1&quot;-1.5&quot; wide and might make the chickshaw heavy to do the whole thing from it.</p>
<figure class="aside--right">

    </picture>
    <figcaption>Turns out, resawing is easier with a sawmill</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I considered cutting it down to have 1/2&quot; boards for the sides and bottom. “Resawing” it, they call it. As in, sawing-again, after the sawmill did its job.</p>
<p>I inherited a band saw a few years ago but I feel inept when behind it. Even if i wasn’t, resawing like this is slow and uneven. It can also be done with a table saw, which I don’t have yet, and with a circular or hand saw, but neither of those looked like fun.</p>
<p>Then I saw a craigslist post labeled <em><strong>“Rough cut hemlock framing.”</strong> He had 8&quot; x 1&quot; boards available.</em> I asked if he’d be willing to cut them down to 1/2&quot; and he agreed!</p>
<p>He didn’t even charge for the extra cuts so in total they came out to 50 cents per board foot. And were sourced from local trees, so that was pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>The pieces were gigantic at 16’ for my little SUV, but I got them home without breaking the roof or having them fly off. After arranging them by my chop saw in my 17’ garage, I cut them down.</p>
<p>I overestimated on both the cedar and hemlock, but this building stuff is fun. I’m happy to have extra.</p>

<h2>To do</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Get waterproof, cleanable flooring.</strong> I probably don't need this but it's been recommended, as this floor won't easily come out. </li>
    <li><strong>Figure roofing.</strong> I didn't think this one through. with the box being 4' x 4', I thought one 8' x 4' metal roofing panel would do, but nope. This didn't account for overlapping the panels and for overhang we'll want on each side.</li>
    <li><strong>Get hardware cloth</strong></li>
</ul>
