		<h3>Every now and then my love for music narrows into obsession.</h3>
		<p>Andy Shauf was one of the lucky ones. It was hearing <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3mnZ0JehmgDBzG0vHScCRH?si=d4b093cf5b9c4c17" title="link to spotify">You&#x27;re Out Wasting</a></em> off of his 2015 <em>Bearer of Bad News</em> that solidified it instantly. It’s hard to pin down why art moves you, but my guess here is the Elliott Smith vibe, the unique three-string chords, the muted drums, the layers of harmonies, and a sticky chorus. <em> / While you&#x27;re out wasting time with the right guy. / </em>Now, I know jack about poetry, but as a designer, I appreciate the hell out of efficiency. That chorus tells the whole story. I ran to my guitar to figure out the main riff.</p>

		<h3>The first line sung at the concert was a thinker.</h3>
		<p>God mulls: <em>/ What happens when they die? Maybe eternal life? /</em> Track one, side one of his newest record <em>Norm</em>. </p>


		<p>Norm’s is a rock opera, so it made sense to play it chronologically. But I enjoyed his sandwich strategy: playing side A fully, mixing it up with some favorites, and then closing out with side B. With an encore, fancy toothpick of <em>The Magician</em> on top.</p>

		<p>One thing that struck me was how the guitar faded into the background. For being “multi-instrumentalist” singer-songwriter, many of his songs still lead with the guitar, on the recordings. This show nudged it to the back for 90% of the time — often using it to fulfill its original purpose as a rhythm instrument. The choice made clear his humbleness of making the song itself shine and not him. This was also seen in the leafy greens in between his face and the spotlight. An earthy take on a front-man wearing sunglasses.</p>

		<h3>His music swells. </h3>
		<p>He knows how to use a rest and how to work with silence. During the quieter moments, the crowd got to murmuring, which annoys a super-fan but I also understood. At times the band resembled ambient background lounge, or veered towards a cocktail jazz band playing to small tables. Maybe murms are just part of being a quieter, understated band. When he had more control of the crowd, the softer moments were murmur-less.</p>

		<p>He showed us his personality a few times during the three banter-breaks, where he asks the audience if they have any questions. His awkwardness is VERY relatable to me, and he leans into it. He writes about it in his reoccurring themes of unrequited love and self-hatred. The audience also relates and is charmed. He skips questions about a Foxwarren reboot and answers what he’s had for dinner. It was chicken. And it was good. He takes a deeper one about why Norm’s name is Norm. Then, we learn he has no pets. We’re getting to know Andy. This is the beginning of a friendship. </p>

		<p>When the music swells loudly, he has the crowd. All six players jam at once at the climax and the crowd eats it up. Twin clarinets, synth, bass, the smiley, expressive, non-stoic band-mate drummer all crash together. There’s only a few songs in his catalog where we hear distortion. At the show, he breaks out the <a href="https://equipboard.com/pros/andy-shauf?gear=guitars#214528">Silvertone</a> to treat us with it during the loud swells. It’s him at his most rock ‘n’ roll. Repeating his stanky riff on the low strings. As the crowd buoys asking for more.</p>

		<!-- <p>The thing is, if you’re following his paintings of tiny, normal moments of life, you're   /i would to epxel a single word, pick uopu yopur telephone/   -->

			<!-- i'm trying to get a lycis in and talk about his lycis being everyday  -->

		<p>Midlake comes to mind. They also rock a multi-flute setup. They had foliage on stage too when I caught them in boston 2010ish. Maybe the flutes require it. One can’t see stage plants and not think of Kurt’s lilies on Nirvana unplugged, especially with Shauf’s shoulder-length locks. As a whole, Shauf’s tunes are more upbeat and bright than Midlake’s deep forest jams. I appreciate them both weaving in the windy sounds. The album <em>Neon Skyline </em>featured less clarinet and more guitar than the other albums, but live, new parts were written for the new instruments and the songs felt more <em>Andy</em>, if that’s possible.</p>

		<p>The last time I saw him was on his <em>Magician</em> tour in Montreal in 2016. I also couldn’t stop watching the drummer there. The drums in his songs are so quiet and sparse and jazzy, especially so live. They’re not just for keeping rhythm. They bring they’re own voice to the conversation. Both of the drummers during those sets just look like they’re having the best time. Also, both were placed at the front of the stage, off to one side, not in the center-back, as usual.</p>

		<p>Watching those expressive drummers made me wonder if something is lacked when someone produces their own record, playing every instrument and part. I think <em>Norm</em> is brilliant all the way through. It’s such a mood. It’s 70’s, disco, and filled with tasty synths. It locks music and themes to characters and stands out among other albums in the indie space. It asks a damn unique thought-experiment of <em>what if God didn't understand love?</em> Here’s the but. But, I wonder what it would look like with more that one mind in the crucible of creation? What if we threw a Paul into the mix? This curiosity came up when the drummer captured us all with a solo. God, it was good. It had me trying to keep up with where he was going to go next, yet having no idea. Each new moment was an eye-squinting, head-bobbing surprise.</p>
		<p>Andy is a storyteller who happens to do music. He's confessed his affinity for short stories. He even hired a <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2211285/andy-shauf-norm-track-by-track/interviews/footnotes-interview/">story editor</a> to help him tighten up story into yummy songs. It was no surprise when he said in a podcast that a book or series of short stories might be on the horizon. </p>


		<p>Hey, you. fyi I'm still working on this article.</p>
		<p>I’ve always considered myself a terrible writer. This is a reflection of my inner psyche and my warped expectations about how a good writer writes fast. Which I do not. This post is me upending the belief and taking a stab at writing about music. A big part of my life that hasn’t worked its way to my web presence. I feel in the minority about the level I love music. I love it as much as I did when I was deep in the confusion of my teenage years when many of us seek out its partnership. That connection tends to drop off for others. Leaving them stuck in a playlist from their formative years.</p>
