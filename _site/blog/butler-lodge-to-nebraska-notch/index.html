    <p>Trails that were probably dry last week now had waterfalls from a recent long-awaited Vermont rain. The rain was done, but the air was wet. Especially when I drummed up perspiration.</p>
<p>The impending wettness stirred up anxiety the night before. Worry one, wet stones. Certain trails in this area have steep sheer rocks as the main trail. This area of the Long Trail is known for <a href="https://sectionhiker.com/vermonts-mount-mansfield-experience-its-best-trails-both-great-and-gnarly-by-matt-heid/#Into%20the%20Rock%20Garden">treacherous footing</a>. Worry number two, I now have a pup, whos coming with. So I have to concern myself with their trail experience on slippery rocks and possible jumps across slippery rocks. Worry three, mortality. My wife is in Europe right now. Although fat-fetched, but I’m the sole person responsible for the kids at the moment, if anything was to happen to me while on the trail, when they came home from school, I wouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>Those were the before thoughts. For the actual trip, reality proved pretty smooth.</p>

<p>Brooklyn the pup was ecstatic off-leash, drifting within a 50-foot radius of me. It was a quiet friday on the trail with only a few cars at the trailhead. I made quick time up the steep climb to Butler Lodge, but not without breath-catching breaks leaning against trees, wondering, “why did I choose this?” The trees up there were mostly coniferous with a splash of color here and there from the understory.</p>

<p>The next line of the triangle, the trail from Butler Lodge to the Twin brooks tenting area, was gentle and scenic. As I decend, the forest updates to birch, beach, and maple with the occasional tiny hemlock. The first round of fall leaves covered the trail, although 80% of the trees here were still green. The path alternated between flat stretches and mild downhill; walking wasn’t exactly easy with so many stones (from softball to small boulder sized) covering the way.</p>
<p>While I was considering my worry, I thought of how much I appreciate signs. Service can be patchy and maps can get lost, but you’ll be fine if the trails are marked and you remember your trail names. This reminded me of a hiking legend of the White Mountainsm Guy Waterman. He hiked all 48 4,000 footers of New Hampshire in winter, from all four directional points. Bushwacking like that requires knowing different, subtler signs like, ridges, rivers, and contour lines. It’s a practiced disorientation which results in a confidence in truing oneself when lost. Maybe that kind of extreme commitment is what’s required to gain a more intimate knowledge of the land in our age.</p>

<p>Seeing the sign for the last junction elated me. Risk of being lost or caught in a rain lessened. The trail flattend and widened. The mist was subsiding and the overcast was starting to break. I enjoyed my thermos of coffee plus protien powder on the last 1.5 miles. (I need to remember this coffee idea.)</p>
<p>Back at the car at 10:45. Legs beat. Got hit by not a raindrop. Good way to start the day.</p>
