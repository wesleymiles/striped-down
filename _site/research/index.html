    	<h1>Research</h1>
		<p>I’ve sat on research teams at two companies. I fell in love with seeing people use the website you spent months on. It was a shock of reality to compare what was created to how it actually works in the wild.</p>
		<p>Different tools offer a different lens to "peek" at users, for example... Heatmaps show where exactly people click. Analitics gives you data about how people find your site, then click around once on it. AB testing is a way to compare two versions of a design idea to see which one works better.</p>
		<p>This page contains a few small research examples.</p>

		<h2>AB testing</h2>
		<h3>Test 1: “Do shorter pages convert less?”</h3>
		<p>This test was about questioning a norm we had in the company for years around content length. Our hypothesis was that less words wouldn’t hurt conversion.</p>
		<p>One barrior we ran up against was that our page-views were very low in the AB testing world, so we bundled the test on 5 clients and aggregated the data. Our writers varied their strategy to provide an alternate view of certain pages.</p>
		<div class="results checks">
			<h4>Results:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Growth in conversions by 16.65% </li>
				<li>No negative effect on keyword visibility after assessing the experiment 6 months after launch.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Impact:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Reduced the load of what writers had to write by half! </li>
				<li>UX benefits: users to get their answer faster. Our pages were quicker to digest and more to-the-point.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>AB test 2: “What CTA button converts better, 'Contact Us' or 'Get in Touch'?”</h3>
		<p>This was a common question between writers and designers. We cycled between 12 different options. It also seemed like a great one to test once we nailed our AB testing process down. We sought to follow takeaways from bigger brands and test button wording. 	</p>
		<p>The statistical significance calculator told us we needed a pretty big boost in conversions to make this test useful.</p>
		<h4>Results:</h4>
		<ul class="checks cross">
			<li>We didn’t get it. Our tool hit its timing limit of 3 months and found no leader. Although inconclusive as a whole, the opposite of our hypothesis was leading the way — “Contact Us” did better than “Get in Touch.” We learned we’d need to make changes with a bigger impact for this amount of traffic.</li>

		<h2>Best practices</h2>
		<p>These are often unspoken and soaked in with team culture. Shining a light on them makes conversations smoother and saves time once spent hashing out definitions.</p>
		<p>Nothing's set in stone. Sometimes the practice breaks a convention enough to retire it. I consider these a type of data because it’s a step toward the objective.</p>

		<h3>Decided to stop using "flippers" on all sites</h3>
		<p>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn’t follow industry, nor usability best practices. These multi-state elements, when hovered by a mouse, turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
			<li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they’re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. Suprising users is a big no-no.</li>
			<li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn’t consider the user.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="caption">The flipper on the left is showing us it's back</p>
		<h3>Moved form field labels from within to above</h3>
		<p>Putting field titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces some clutter, but we decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic.</p>
		<p>Cons: As the viewer begins to type their responses in the form field, the prompt disappears. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may confuse someone. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</p>
		<p>This is common knowledge these days, but at the time there wasn't as clear a winner.</p>

		<h3>Created governance for growing agency</h3>

		<div class="results checks">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Conversion principles: Design methods for turning users into leads </h4>
					<p>This document which helped get the design team and others discussing design on the same page. As a company, we all agreed these principles.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Anatomy of a Website: A Guide to Website Terminology</h4>
					<p>The precursor to our pattern library. We had the common startup disease jargon-itis. I lead the creation of this 23 page design glossary naming and defining of every site piece, including crowd favorites "banner", "hero", and "quicklink."</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Design portfolio mini-site</h4>
					<p>This internal tool showcased our best sites and was primarily for Sales and Project Management when showcasing our design work. It reinforced the content from the two docs above: a common vocabulary and our conversion principles.</p>

		<h2 id="landing_pages">Personas</h2>
		<p>The goals of this project was two-fold: to make our landing pages less manual to build and to design them in a way that speaks more directly to users problems. My fellow researchers and I tackled the later.</p>
		<p>Our clients get the bulk of thier work through phone calls. As such, we had the technology in place and ability to listen to their customer calls. With the raw call data, we grouped the trends into four personas, each with a unique user-story.</p>
		<p>Each persona varied enough to warrant highlighting different content depending on their situation, so they each got their own landing page design.</p>
		<img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" alt="Image of persona, their pain-points, who they are, why they’re on this site - and a small wireframe" />
		<p class="caption">Persona and low-fi wireframe for content planning</p>

		<p>For example, someone with a plumbing emergency needs to know the company can fix the problem fast, as opposed to someone considering a new heating system, who may want to learn more about the system and company installing it.</p>
		<img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" alt="Image of 2 wireframes from a landing page about heating services. No images and little style, mostly grey boxes showing structure." />
		<p class="caption">High-fi wireframe</p>
		<div class="results checks">
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Marketers who create landing pages now have four versions of layouts to choose from. Each corresponds with the top four customer needs.</li>
				<li>New system populates dynamic content from styles specified from designers and can launch hundreds can be created at a time.</li>
			</ul>
