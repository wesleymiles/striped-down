			<h2>1. Early Voice &amp; Contributor to Pattern Library for Marketing Agency</h2>
			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>The company built sites mostly from scratch. Devs and designers use their own methods of reusing code and design.</li>
			    <li>Designers delivered desktop mockups only, so devs were responsible for all breakdowns. Because many design decisions were made by non-designers, the mobile ux was subpar.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>
			    	I was excited about Atomic Design and pitched it to the tech team to improve our reusing methods.
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/early-wireframe.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/early-wireframe.png" alt="early wireframe of pattern library idea" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	It didn't catch on, but the spark surfaced a need to unify the names of every site piece. I joined a team that created a company-wide glossary. 
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" alt="Anatomy of a website document screenshot" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	A year later, the company was ready to implement. My team and I designed three responsive views for each piece of functionality, based on  existing sites.
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/progress.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/progress.png" alt="responsive views of 5 pattern variations, with live sites" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>Since I understand front-end code, I acted as the conduit to development during build.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>A year later we had a working library of 60 patterns for dev and design to leverage reusing work</li>
			    <li>A process for library maintenance</li>
			    <li>Improved dev efficiently from 10 to 5 days, and design from 4 to 3 days</li>
			    <li>Our site&rsquo;s mobile experience improved because the patterns included every responsive view.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. Improving Outated Landing Page Designs</h2>
			<p>Summary: </p>

			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>Many of our 300 clients use landing pages to drive traffic from various marketing channels. They all use a single template which was outdated, not optimized for conversion, and manual to launch.</li>
			    <li>Our company prioritized improving this system. The goal was to have pages designed and built with specific purposes in mind aligned with Vertical / Segment / Service data.</li>
			    <li>I was the designer on the research team converting our findings into visuals.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>Our research team listened to customer calls to determine the buyer personas that were common.</li>
			    <li>Together, we created four personas and created four types of landing page user stories.</li>
			    <li>
			    	<p>Based on our findings, I designed a low-fi wireframe that satisfied our personas and the dynamic features the system was receiving. I leaned on internal and industry best practices for landing pages.</p>
		        <p><em>For example, someone with a plumbing emergency needs to know the company can fix the problem fast, as opposed to someone considering a new heating system, who may want to learn a lot about the system and company installing it.</em></p>
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" alt="Image of persona, their pain-points, who they are, why they're on this site - and a small wireframe" /></a>
		    	</li>
			    <li>
			    	In response to feedback from stakeholders, I designed higher fidelity wireframes.
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" alt="Image of 2 wireframes from a landing page about heating services. No images and little style, mostly grey boxes showing structure." /></a>
			  </li>
			    <li>Once approved, the design team and I retrofit existing clients to the new system and created processes to get new clients up and running.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Result:&nbsp;</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>New landing page system launched.</li>
			    <ol>
			        <li>It populates with dynamic content from our dashboard and styles specified from designers.</li>
			        <li>Hundreds can be created at a time now.</li>
			        <li>Once the styles are added in from design, future landing page designs will have a base to pull from. It's a version of a living style guide.</li>
			    </ol>
			</ol>
			<p class="lessons-learned">Lesson: This project was a challenge because no one person owned it. Thus there was no authority to go for questions. It was a learning experience for the company. </em></p>
