			<h2>1. Early Voice &amp; Contributor to Pattern Library for Marketing Agency</h2>
			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>The company built sites mostly from scratch. Devs and designers use their own methods of reusing code and design.</li>
			    <li>Designers delivered desktop mockups only, so devs were responsible for all breakdowns. Because many design decisions were made by non-designers, the mobile ux was subpar.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>
			    	I was excited about Atomic Design and pitched it to the tech team to improve our reusing methods.
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/early-wireframe.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/early-wireframe.png" alt="early wireframe of pattern library idea" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	It didn't catch on, but the spark surfaced a need to unify the names of every site piece. I joined a team that created a company-wide glossary. 
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" alt="Anatomy of a website document screenshot" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	A year later, the company was ready to implement. My team and I designed three responsive views for each piece of functionality, based on  existing sites.
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/progress.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/progress.png" alt="responsive views of 5 pattern variations, with live sites" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>Since I understand front-end code, I acted as the conduit to development during build.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>A year later we had a working library of 60 patterns for dev and design to leverage reusing work</li>
			    <li>A process for library maintenance</li>
			    <li>Improved dev efficiently from 10 to 5 days, and design from 4 to 3 days</li>
			    <li>Our site&rsquo;s mobile experience improved because the patterns included every responsive view.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. Improving Outated Landing Page Designs</h2>

			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>Many of our 300 clients use landing pages to drive traffic from various marketing channels. They all use a single template which was outdated, not optimized for conversion, and manual to launch.</li>
			    <li>The company green-lit improving this system with the goal of having pages designed and built with specific purposes in mind and leveraging existing data.</li>
			    <li>I sat on the research team converting findings into visuals.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>Our research team listened to customer calls to determine common buyer personas.</li>
			    <li>Together, we created four personas and user-stories tying them to various types of landing pages.</li>
			    <li>
			    	<p>Based on our findings, I designed a low-fi wireframe that satisfied our personas and the dynamic features the system was receiving. I leaned on internal and industry best practices for landing pages.</p>
		        <p><em>For example, someone with a plumbing emergency needs to know the company can fix the problem fast, as opposed to someone considering a new heating system, who may want to learn a lot about the system and company installing it.</em></p>
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" alt="Image of persona, their pain-points, who they are, why they're on this site - and a small wireframe" /></a>
		    	</li>
			    <li>
			    	In response to feedback from stakeholders, I designed higher fidelity wireframes.
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" alt="Image of 2 wireframes from a landing page about heating services. No images and little style, mostly grey boxes showing structure." /></a>
			  </li>
			    <li>Once approved, the design team and I retrofit existing clients to the new system and created processes to get new clients up and running.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Result:&nbsp;</h4>
			<ol>
			    <li>New landing page system launched.</li>
			    <ol>
			        <li>
			        	It populates with dynamic content from our dashboard and styles specified from designers.
		    				<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/dynamic-sq.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/dynamic-sq.png" alt="2 screenshots from the elements and molecules section of the dynamic style guide." /></a>
			        </li>
			        <li>Hundreds can be created at a time now.</li>
			        <li>
			        	Once the styles are added in from design, future landing page designs will have a base to pull from. It's a version of a living style guide.

			    </ol>
			</ol>
			<p class="lessons-learned"><em>Lesson: This project was a challenge across the board because no one person owned it. So there was no authority to go for questions. It launched and was a success but was a serious learning experience for the company about PM.</em></p>

			<h2>3. Couple AB Testing Wins</h2>
			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<p>As a new team, we had no systems of process yet, just the dream of data. On it sat an SEO specialist, a developer, a SEM specialist, and le designer (moi).</p>
			</ol>
			<h4>Actions / Results</h4>
			
			    <p><strong>Processes!</strong> I lead the following:</p>
			    <ul>
			        <li>Deciding platforms for AB testing and heatmaps</li>
			        <li>Creating and implementing processes of workflow</li>
			        <li>Running tests and answering questions as they came in</li>
			    </ul>
			
			    <p><strong>Proved a reduced wordcount doesn't ruin SEO!</strong></p>
			     <ul>
			        <li>I helped run and stratagize AB tests for existing content length vs shorter content length.</li>
			        <li>Our pageviews were low, so we bundled the test on 5 clients for more data.</li>
			        <li>The UX improved because no one likes reading an SEO-stuffed page and conversion improved.
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Retired a button strategy becuase of data!</strong></p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Upon research, we learned the hero button flippers we used didn&rsquo;t follow best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</li>
			    <ul>
			        <li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
			        <li>In touchscreens, they lack an indication they&rsquo;re flippable. So people get suprised, which is a no-no.</li>
			        <li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more than we considered what links went on the back. A classic link-dump situation that doesn't consider the user.</li>
			    </ul>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Learned our hero buttons convert better when they go to a service page rather than a form page!</strong></p>
			    <ul>
						<li>(the buttons had variations of a service like "Air Conditioning", or the more converstional "I need Air Conditioning")</li>
			        <li>Using 3 research methods (heatmaps, click-tracking, and analytics research), I determined that:</li>
			        <ul>
			            <li>They get a good amount of engagement so we should keep using them.</li>
			            <li>We should stop sending people to forms. Service pages convert better. <em>This may be because someone ends up on a form page too early in the process, before getting a chance to research if the company is a good fit.</em></li>
			        </ul>
			    </ul>

			<p><strong>Moved field titles outside of the text-field box!</strong></p>
			    <ul>
			        <li>Putting the titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces a little clutter. We decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic. </li>
			        <li>As the viewer would begin to type their responses in the form fields, the prompt would disappear. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may be confusing for the user. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</li>
    		</ul>

			<p class="lessons-learned"><em>Lesson: AB tests need A LOT of data for statistical signifigance. This posed an issue for the numbers our clients brought in, so we resort strategically </em></p>
