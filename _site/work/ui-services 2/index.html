		<h1>User Interface Design</h1>
		<p>The core service I provide is bringing expressing brands online. Like a PR makeover, your brand and message get shown in the best light possible. </p>
		<p>I helped build a pattern library to use across all clients at my agency. Each website recieved a different feel with different services emphasized, while being quick to build. I’m up to 300+ custom sites over the last 6 years.</p>
		<p>Below is an overview of the process and a few examples:</p>

Constraints stimulate innovation

My primary charge was to design sites that provided leads to contractors — essentially the same site over and over again. That constraint supported my growth as a designer by encouraging resourcefulness and inventiveness. Other constraints were annoying at first but ended up giving that little push toward innovation, such as:

    Only using Google Fonts
    Set content requirements for SEO strategy
    Quality of client photography (we did all we could to avoid stock photos)
    Quality of client branding (iMarket didn’t do identity)

To demonstrate my various solutions to the same content, take a look at the links at the bottom of this article.

			<li>Role: design</li>
			<li>Deliverables: 2 templates - homepage & subpage; plus interactions</li>
			<li>Collaborators: client, content writer, developer, project manager</li>
			<li>Goals: represent the brand, optimized to convert, doesn’t stray from pattern library</li>
			<li>Clients: medium-sized (3M-20M) contracting companies of Plumbers, HVAC Technicians, and Electricians.</li>
			<li>Process as equation: provided files + video call with client + design the thing + design critique + present to client + multiple rounds + dev QC = launched website.</li>
