    <p>We had inefficiency from design and dev building every site from scratch. After collaborating with the design team and dev team we created a pattern library which shaved 2 days off of dev build time and 1 off of design.</p>

    <p>We had inefficiency from design and dev building every site from scratch. After collaborating with the design team and dev team we created a pattern library which shaved 2 days off of dev build time and 1 off of design.</p>
    <p>My part in this projecy was creating new patterns, maintaining existing patterns, writing documentation, and (the big one)using the library. Each desiign required staying within the bounds of each pattern.</p>

    <h2>Created Strong Identity Systems for 400 Small Businesses</h2>
    <h4 class="details">
        <span>Designer  |  </span>

        <span>5 years </span>
    </h4>

    <p>Clients often came to our marketing company with very little. Usually a logo and that logo applied to their service truck. With that, I created an identity system and applied it to a new website. The system was then used for other products, like social media, email marketing, and remarketing.</p>
    <p>Specifically, the system included fonts, colors, buttons, patterns, custom iconography like guarantees and warranties, and occasionally a mascot.</p>

    <h2>Mockup Demo Tool</h2>
    <h4>Role: Design, Development, PM</h4>
    <h4>Results: Legacy tool</h4>
    <h4>Timeline: 1 month</h4>

    <p>We had a clunky PDF method for presenting site mockups to clients which resulted in lots of questions from clients. My simple solution received almost immediate positive feedback from managers and clients.</p>
    <p>I initiated and championed this small project from pitch to launch.</p>

<h2>Rock & Roll Daycare</h2>
<h4>Role: Custom UI Design / Art Direction</h4>
<p>Supported growth of award-winning Boston Montessori School</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2><p>One of my freelance clients was starting a new venture. Since we collaborated on a different music academy website, much of the functionality was able to be reused. The design goals were to increase sign-ups and provide info to existing customers. The back-end required the ability to add faculty, update availability, and edit content sections. The old and new one would be using WordPress.</p>
<h3>Available Resources</h3>
<p>I wore all of the required hats: design, development, mailchimp integration, and ongoing support. For the other music academy site, I joined forces with a developer. The client supplied all content.</p>
<h2>Process &amp; Timeline</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Define the scope and timeline for both parties</li>
    <li>Design blocky wireframes to focus broadly</li>
    <li>Complete style guide to touch on the details</li>
    <li>Develop beta site</li>
    <li>Connect mailing list and create email marketing strategy</li>
    <li>Launch and deliver documentation: WordPress Tips and Website Manual</li>
    <li>Maintenance and updates during our 2 year relationship.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>The most challenging part of the project was expanding the site&#8217;s capabilities as the business grew. They began with one location and added three more. The growth meant more faculty roles tied to particular locations. I felt over my head and reached out to developer friends who set me back on the right path. With their help a solution was delivered. It was a reminder for me of the importance of your actual social network.</p>
<p><em>Deliverables: Site design, Custom WordPress Theme, WordPress Manual, Website Manual, Email integration</em></p>
