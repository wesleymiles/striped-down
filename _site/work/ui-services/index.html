		<h1>User Interface Design</h1>
		<p>Like a PR makeover, I translate brands and messages across media in a way that reaches an intended audience.</p>
		<p>This page discusses the process and gives three examples.</p>

		<h3>UI for websites & beyond</h3>
		<p>For the last 6 years, I’ve focused on creating responsive websites in the Home Services industry. The high-level to the low. Art direction to evoke the right emotion for the audience, and pixel-perfect details to execute that connection using visuals.</p>

		<p>But the umbrella of UI is wide and also includes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dashboard design</li>
			<li>Internal marketing for social media, ads, and print</li>
			<li>Style guides</li>
			<li>Email marketing</li>
			<li>Really, any work that involves visuals</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>A peek behind the curtain</h2>
		<p>The process of a site design within our team of 3.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><h3>Discovery</h3></li>
			<p>Designers were provided a questionnaire filled out by the client including a vision, a brand, assets, and specific goals. Then we held a video call where we filled in any gaps needed to nail the design.</p>
			<p>My responsibility is to design a site that meets these goals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Align branding to feel 100% custom</li>
				<li>Optimize for lead conversion</li>
				<li>Wow the client by acheiving their goals</li>
				<li>Adhering to the design system and follow SEO guidelines</li>
			</ol>

			<li><h3>Research</h3></li>
			<p>Here, I learn about their competitors and their audience and consider what general style we’ll be using. I still use Dribbble during this stage, especially if I have a challenging color to work with. In addition, I scour my 10 years of evernote snippets for relevant solutions.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/evernote.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Style guide</h3></li>
			<p>I create a style guide for each client in adobe XD. At this stage the wide research stage comes to a point to make decisions and put findings in order. It’s not a linear process. I throw what I think will /img/into the style guide then take it for a spin on the artboard. The creation of the design happens along-side the actual design, together. The style guide gets completed first usually, and most of the time goes into applying it to content sections and pages. </p>
			<p>The logo is central to a brand. I use it and any other marketing materials provided to flesh out the style guide.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/styleguide.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Design the thing</h3></li>
			<p>This is the intuitive, gut-stage and the hardest to write about.</p>
			<p>The header and footer are easy places to start. Early wins can snowball into momentum. While working at the header, I’ll still get ideas for other sections so I’ll do what I can to manifest the ideas. Whatever has the most promise, I follow. Sometimes this means focusing intensely on one thing until it clicks, while other times it involves hopping from section to section looking for a piece of promise.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/design-snippet.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Critique</h3></li>
			<p>The key feedback loop that helps catch issues early and draw designers out of our heads. The CRO lead discusses the homepage design with the design team.</p>

		<h2>Nautical-Themed HVAC</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/charter.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>My agency didn’t offer branding, so I have lots of experience making sub-par logos shine. Charter, on the other hand, had a fresh rebrand, which helped me tell their story.</p>

		<h2>Retro HVAC Brand</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/natals.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>One constraint we had was only using google fonts. Here, I spice things up with a graphic of script not available from google. Mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the pattern library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

		<h2>A Plumber with Serifs</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/saddleback.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>We don’t see many serif fonts in this industry so this was a bit of a novelty. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‘smart’ components, colors, and character styles. View the site to see animations like the truck sliding in.</p>
