			<li>Dashboard design: Improved the use of client-facing dashboard</li>
			<li>Internal marketing: social media, remarketing, print asset creation</li>

		<h1>Process of a site design</h1>

		<h2>Situation</h2>
		<p>Client comes to me with a vision, a brand, assets, and specific goals. We then have a video call where I listen and confirm their vision. </p>
		<p>My responsibility here is to design them a site that meet these goals: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Align branding to feel 100% custom</li>
			<li>Optimize for lead conversion</li>
			<li>Wow the client by acheiving their goals</li>
			<li>Adhering to the design system and follow SEO guidelines</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Action</h2>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Research</strong></li>
			<p>Here, I learn about competitors and dig into the ideal style. My evernote collection has 10 years of snippets and dribbble is still my goto for more ideas.</p>
			<img src="/img/evernote.png" />

			<li><strong>Style guide</strong></li>
			<p>I create a style guide for each client in adobe XD. At this stage the wide research stage comes to a point to make decisions and put findings in order. It’s not a linear process. I throw what I think will /img/into the style guide then take it for a spin on the artboard. The creation of the design happens along-side the actual design, together. The style guide gets completed first usually, and most of the time goes into applying it to content sections and pages. </p>
			<p>The logo is central to a brand. I use it and any other marketing materials provided to flesh out the style guide.</p>
			<img src="/img/styleguide.png" />

			<li><strong>Design the thing</strong></li>
			<p>This is the intuitive, gut-stage and the hardest to write about.</p>
			<p>I like starting at the header or footer to arrange the standard items. It can be an easy win. Early wins often snowball into beautiful momentum. While working on the header, I may get an idea for another section, so I’ll tend to manifesting that idea. Whatever has the most steam, excitement, and promise, I follow. Sometimes that means focusing intently on the header and finishing it until it works, and sometimes it means scrambling from section to section to section to find a piece of promise in the corner of the reviews block.</p>
			<p>The goal here is a solution that can be seen or at least explained. You should be able to present your vision using the design itself and an explanation to fill in the holes.</p>
			<img src="/img/design-snippet.jpg" />

			<li><strong>Critique</strong></li>
			<p>I spearheaded adding critique to the process, now I think it's the . The design team and CRO lead discuss the homepage design. This collaboration pushes designers and catches issues earlier on.</p>

	<h2>Nautical-Themed HVAC</h2>
	<img src="/img/charter.jpg" alt="" />
	<p>My agency didn’t offer branding, so I have lots of experience making sub-par logos shine. Charter, on the other hand, had a fresh rebrand, which helped me tell their story.</p>

	<h2>Retro HVAC Brand</h2>
	<img src="/img/natals.jpg" alt="" />
	<p>One constraint we had were only using google fonts. Here, I spiced things up with a graphic of script not available from google. Mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the patter library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

	<h2>A Plumber with Serifs</h2>
	<img src="/img/saddleback.jpg" alt="" />
	<p>There aren’t many serif fonts in this industry, so this was a bit different. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‘smart’ components, colors, and character styles. See the link below to watch fun animations like the truck sliding in.</p>
