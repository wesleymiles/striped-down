						<p>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn’t follow industry best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
							<li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they’re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. A no-no.</li>
							<li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn’t consider the user.</li>

				<p>We determined to fully support browsers which contribute 1%+ of traffic to our top sites. Then decided to support browsers that provide .05%-1% on an as requested basis. We stopped supporting browsers that provide less than .04% of traffic.</p>

				<p>I helped run and strategize an AB test for existing content length vs shorter content length. Our hypothesis was that less words wouldn’t hurt conversion.</p>
		    <p>Our page-views were low, so we bundled the test on 5 clients and aggregated the data.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Growth in conversions by 16.65% </li>
					<li>No negative effect on keyword visibility. (This was found after assessing the experiment 6 months after launch)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Impact:</h4>
		    <ul>
					<li>Reduced the load of what writers had to write by half! </li>

				<p>On our first AB test, we sought to follow takeaways from bigger brands and test button wording. Our sites have the button wording vary from about 10 different options. </p>
				<p>The statistical significance calculator told us we needed a pretty big boost in conversions to make this test useful.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <p>We didn’t get it. Optimize went to its timing limit of 3 months over 3,471 Sessions and found no leader. Although inconclusive as a whole, the opposite of our hypothesis was leading the way —  “Contact Us” did better than “Get in Touch.” We learned we'd need to make changes with a bigger impact for this amount of traffic.</p>

					<li>Average conversion rate: 14.09% (not bad compared to industry-standards).</li>
					<li>This accounted for 20.78% of all form leads and 4.83% of all leads. It proved safe to keep using them as we were. </li>

				<h3>An aid to Conversion Analysis</h3>
				<p>We had an unhappy client who was convinced their site was under-performing.</p>
				<p>We had no data that suggested there is a serious problem with conversion, since organic Cost Per Lead was strong. We performed this analysis in light of the client’s concerns about the drop in leads.</p>
				<p>Overall, the analysis showed that their site was overdue for a redesign. It was outdated, too busy, and broke current internal best practice</p>
				<h4>To support these claims, heatmaps proved:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>There were poor design choices. Users didn’t always know what was a link and what’s wasn't</li>
					<li>There were excessive items in the nav. One had very low engagement that could be de-emphasized. </li>
					<li>We had little engagement on one of the two main CTA buttons. This supported a best practice of having only one.</li>
