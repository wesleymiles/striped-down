						<p>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn’t follow industry best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
							<li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they’re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. A no-no.</li>
							<li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn’t consider the user.</li>

						<p>Putting field titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces some clutter, but we decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic.</p>
						<p><em>Cons: As the viewer begins to type their responses in the form field, the prompt disappears. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may confuse someone. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</em></p>

				<p>Looked at a year of data for our top traffic clients to determine what percentage of traffic was coming from various browsers.</p>
				<h4>Result: Stopped support for older browsers which freed up dev time</h4>
				<p>We determined to fully support browsers which contribute 1%+ of traffic to our top sites. Decided to support browsers that provide .05%-1% on an as requested basis. Stopped supporting browsers that provide less than .04% of traffic.</p>

				<p>Here's what we did:</p>
				<ol class="legend">
					<li><strong>Nav overhaul.</strong> We use 3 main sections: side menu, header, and content area. Then broke horizontal nav bars into a header and vertical menu. This follows a convention people are used to and separates the multiple stacked navigations. </li>
					<li><strong>Emphasized company.</strong> Because this upgrade was primarily for clients, we wanted to let them know it was THEIR dashboard by adding their logo and a big company name.</li>
					<li><strong>Breadcrumbs.</strong> To let client know how to get home and go back while digging into their data.</li>

				<h3>"Do shorter pages convert less?”</h3>
				<p>I helped run and strategize an AB test for existing content length vs shorter content length. Our hypothesis was that less words wouldn’t hurt conversion.</p>
		    <p>Our page-views were low, so we bundled the test on 5 clients and aggregated the data.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Growth in conversions by 16.65% </li>
					<li>No negative effect on keyword visibility. (This was found after assessing the experiment 6 months after launch)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Impact:</h4>
		    <ul>
					<li>Reduced the load of what writers had to write by half! </li>
					<li>UX benefits: Allows users to get their answer faster. Quicker to digest. More to-the-point.</li>

				<h3>“What CTA button converts better, 'Contact Us' or 'Get in Touch'?</h3>
				<p>On our first AB test, we sought to follow takeaways from bigger brands and test button wording. Our sites have the button wording vary from about 10 different options. </p>
				<p>We ran the estimates through the statistical significance calculator telling us we would need a pretty big boost in conversions to make this test useful.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <p>We didn’t get it. Optimize went to its timing limit of 3 months over 3,471 Sessions and found no leader. Although inconclusive as a whole, the opposite of our hypothesis was leading the way —  “Contact Us” did better than “Get in Touch.”</p>
