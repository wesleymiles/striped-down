        &lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pen and inkwash drawing of a scene from our front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our house is placed super close to the road, as is the set of mostly unused barns across the street. They just reroofed the tilted one so it might have more hope than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting into a groove of creating these type of sketches. A new page layout is on the way…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What happened in 2024</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;
    &lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Dec 31, 2024&quot;&gt;Written: Dec 31, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What happened in 2024&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First yearly review in years. I traveled more than usual, discovered I’m an HSP (highly sensitive person), and read some good books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my life is taken up with family and my job, and both of those are generally fulfilling, although also draining. I didn’t achieve my goal of doing daily deep work. I did some, but generally felt barely above water. It’s tough out there, and I’ll try again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most consistent activity: pickup soccer on sundays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poem I tried to memorize: &lt;a href=&quot;https://onbeing.org/poetry/the-peace-of-wild-things&quot;&gt;The Peace of Wild Things, by Wendell Berry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proudest work project: user research about docs at Red Hat Summit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favorite book: Wellness, by Nathan Hill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favorite home related-thing: removed a chimney that was taking up space in the garage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favorite record: Manning Fireworks, by MJ Lenderman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favorite painted work: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.are.na/block/24724142&quot;&gt;Winter Blanket, by Eric G. Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;biggest high: youngest went to kindergarten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lowest low: de quervains didn’t clear up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;camping trips: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;big hikes: camels hump in winter, moosilauke mt in nh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concerts: Chris Cohen, Flaming Lips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;favorite photo I took: family waiting for the bus and a european trashcan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/fam.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/fam.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/fam.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Open Yale Course&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound up working my way through the syllabus of &lt;a href=&quot;https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-291&quot;&gt;The American Novel Since 1945&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with David Foster Wallace. I devoured his short stories in his collection Oblivion. The theme here is I apparently enjoy literary analysis; that is, hearing other smarties discuss what I just read. Like overhearing a book club in the library. A podcast about Oblivion turned me on to DFW’s influences. Thomas Pynchon stood out and led me to read The Crying of Lot 49. The best analysis I found for THAT one was by the Yale professor of English. She videoed the class in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for: a curated list of books by someone who knows how to pick books with a corresponding lecture or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading these, I’m about halfway through the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Wright, Black Boy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flannery O’Connor, Wise Blood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Kerouac, On the Road&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J.D. Salinger, Franny and Zooey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Barth, Lost in the Funhouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other book highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down With The System, by Serj Tankian. While not a huge fan, SOAD was solidly within my musical world. I wasn’t ready for the activism bend, but I stayed for it. Serj is an earnest fellow who inspires me to stand up for what I believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At Work in the Ruins: Finding Our Place in the Time of Science, Climate Change, Pandemics and All the Other Emergencies, by Dougald Hine. I missed the local book signing, but it put the work on my radar. I adored Hospicing Modernity; the only book I’ve participated in book club for. This one is in the same genre: staring and wondering at the crumbling systems and institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia, by Ursula K. Le Guin. My first Le Guin, this was a banger and also within the realm of critiquing the direction of the western world, this time through a sci-fi narrative written in the 70s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirkwork.com/guantanamo-voices-book&quot;&gt;Guantanamo Voices&lt;/a&gt;: True Accounts from the World’s Most Infamous Prison, by Sarah Mirk. I met the author at the non-fiction comics fest in vermont and bought the book immediately. It’s beautiful and wrenching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip to Poland to visit my wife’s family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work trip to Denver for the Red Hat Summit event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of december trip to Tucson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/tucsan.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/tucsan.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/2024-review/img/tucsan.jpg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of home projects, what comes to mind is that the kitchen is done, even though it was finished in 2023. I’ve legally agreed not to mention the company that stretched out the remodel to 10 months of living with a jagged plywood countertop. So we’ll leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Replaced leaky and inoperable windows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of an addition from the 80s, they were the newest windows in the house, and the worst. Gigantic and, because the counterweight broke, heavy. The rest of the windows are original single-pane from 1937 and working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept the holes the same size and put in sliders. The addition has the best view in the home, and the new windows accentuate that now. The next step is keeping it warm. The wood stove heat doesn’t make it out to that extremity well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Removed an old chimney&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one felt so so good. A weight was removed along with the concrete. It was tied to a wood stove that has since been removed and was once used to keep the aforementioned cold room warm. The chimney took up space in an already cramped garage and up on the roof, the bricks stayed in place by gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yard projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Got us some chickens in the spring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1&quot;&gt;a coop&lt;/a&gt;, which I was very proud of, because I have not built many things. We got 4 eggs a day from our 4 hens, 2 more recently due to the cold or lack of sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ran a decent annual garden&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield: 60 lbs potatoes, lots of tomatoes, 20 delicata, 50 garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;duds: carrots, beets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thrivers: kale, parsley, tomatillos (family doesn’t like them 😞), black beans (first time 🎉)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potatoes took a hit from burrowing chompers and jumping worms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strawberries planted in tree guilds did better than in the bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up drip irrigation, which was a game-changer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Maintained perennials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boom year for raspberries (could be because I restrung their supports)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;average year for blueberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dud year from the apple tree (because last year was a boom). I plan to heavily prune it to even out the crops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was not faster than the quick birdies in getting elderberries or currants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Plant dreams&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants I considered but didn’t get around to: mulberries. I had some delish local fruit in Bristol, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Perfectcircle.Farm/mulberry/mulberry-2hk6z&quot;&gt;Perfect circle farm&lt;/a&gt;. They also source trees. I failed at establishing lupin, but will try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added 2 hazelberts and an apple, gifted by a neighbor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added Japanese spirea near the river from the local classifieds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moved 2 plum trees closer to each other to encourage cross-pollination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added this organic material: 1 trailer of wood chips, 1 trailer of composted horse manure, and 9 bales of mulch hay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Freelance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logo and website for &lt;a href=&quot;https://unitedchurchofunderhill.com&quot;&gt;my parents’ church&lt;/a&gt; (and mine, he said reluctantly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphic design for the 50th anniversary of our Harvest Market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website maintenance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefarmbetween.com&quot;&gt;A Farm Between&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brochure design and copy for the Jericho/Underhill Food Hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full-time work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the year 90% dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;docs.redhat&lt;/a&gt;. This was a big shift from focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://redhat.com/&quot;&gt;redhat.com&lt;/a&gt;, as docs are more like a product than a marketing site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software documentation guides users through every stage of product use, from onboarding to productive operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. From the company’s perspective, it’s a self-service tool for users to get themselves unstuck and on to their goal. It’s highly visited and gets 150k page-views every weekday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project focused on separating docs from the support site and creating a standalone platform. This involved designing a new homepage, developing new templates, converting custom elements to design system components, and ensuring a seamless separation of docs from support content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration: the 3-person design team (including me), 13 engineers, and spokespeople for the army of content writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phase 1: migration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the thing moved in time for Red Hat Summit event. All 800k pages of it. To me, the highlight was the ease and quickness of using the components from our design system. Therefore, the work to adopt the header and footer was spent on a linking strategy and not functionality or responsive spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Side quest: user research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team rallied behind seeing what people thought about the new site. The Red Hat event was filled with passionate users of Red Hat Documentation and was a perfect opportunity. I was part of a scrappy research team who led this work. Starting in january, we built a study to learn the sentiment of the updates and what users thought was missing. The study included a combo of survey questions and talk-aloud usability scenarios. It did not disappoint. I helped share out the results to 5+ teams and it’s already shaped and prioritized features. It was the project I was most proud of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phase 2: migrating other sites to docs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A primary reason for giving docs its own url was to reduce the sprawl of other rh docs sites. Openshift docs was first. As it was, its content was basically duplicated on a separate site and on the new docs.redhat. The separate one had ux and organization that its users loved. So the team did our best to incorporate those features into the main site before we migrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Successes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Never felt so generally content with my life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest. The stability of a good job and a family brings so much damn joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gave a best man speech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof, I was anxious for about a year leading up to this one. While in front of the crowd I disassociated a tad while giving it, but it went well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Still drawn to the manifesting teachings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Goddard&quot;&gt;Neville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is that I’m improving at imagining things working out. This is a profound shift in a head where negative self-talk has been a roommate for decades. New thought FTW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Social sensitivity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, social situations trigger me to shut down and retreat in my head. When it happens, my self-awareness and overthinking skyrocket. I feel blocked, terrified of the spotlight. Diagnosing myself as a highly sensitive person (HSP) is the best explanation for how this feels. The label offers a framework to understand my behavior, challenges, and strengths, and has helped make sense of my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dealing with a wet basement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermont had unprecedented flooding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/vermont-floods-storm-destruction-boat-rescues&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;… Water seeps into our concrete basement during heavy rain. A trench drain encircling the house could fix it, though it ain’t cheap. The current solution is a sump pump in the corner of a floor that no longer slopes toward it. I spent two wet days troubleshooting that pump this year. While soggy, messing with the back-flow valve, I realized the importance of a fallback pump. My working plan is to add a second sump in the next lowest area of the floor, but I’ve been putting it off because of the idea of using a jackhammer, and also, the expanding list of home projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My wrist injury &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/de-quervain-tenosynovitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371332#dialogId50205877&quot;&gt;de quervain’s tenosynovitis&lt;/a&gt; persisted&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened november 2023. Out of nowhere, one day I woke up and my left thumb joint killed. Soon after I discovered what this freak syndrome is; also known as mommy or gamer thumb. I believe it became inflamed because of small repeated actions of using shortcuts on my keyboard for 20 years, playing guitar, and more recently, drums. The condition limits full use of my left thumb and flares while twisting a jar or carrying wood, so I baby it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, my doctor proved the injury was indeed this. I did some PT, wore a brace, got a split-keyboard, and saw no results. Later in the year, I went to a hand-wrist specialist and they said it’s probably not healing because of my double-jointed thumb. It shows signs of early thumb arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Screen fatigue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, my body shuts down from seemingly too much screen time. It happens when I’m in long, back-to-back meetings. I get a sensation that starts in my eyes and I’m forced to lie down. I wonder how I ever got through 8+ hours of this while in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Onward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 themes that make sense to focus on the day I’m writing this, december 31, 2024. Knowing they’ll change and how I do not excel at proper goal setting, these are themes as goals are too damn rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritize meditating and reading over screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push for opening up and sharing a bit of myself at work in every meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write more. Help fill the gap in support expressing myself besides through f2f, specifically by publishing blog posts and journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deal seriously with anxiety; could be new tactics to improve recall or medication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do more adventures (more camping, more big hikes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to make the above line up with full moons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lifted this epic categorization below from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/The48LawsOfPower/comments/ypzvua/a_very_comprehensive_summary_of_the_48_laws_of/&quot;&gt;ToSummarize&lt;/a&gt;, from reddit. Maybe I’ll incorporate it to the cards… If you want to dig into more, click the number links below. They’ll land you on their site on the subject, which is very worth while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pay attention to people and understand human nature, including your own (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-19-know-who-youre-dealing-with-do-not-offend-the-wrong-person&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-33-discover-each-mans-thumbscrew&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Actions, symbols and emotions are more convincing than words (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-9-win-through-your-actions-never-through-argument&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-27-play-on-peoples-need-to-believe-to-create-a-cult-like-following&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-32-play-to-peoples-fantasies&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-37-create-compelling-spectacles&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-43-work-on-the-hearts-and-minds-of-others&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Self-interest is a more reliable motivator than gratitude or mercy (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-13-when-asking-for-help-appeal-to-peoples-self-interest-never-to-their-mercy-or-gratitude&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). Gratitude is a burden and people will try to rid themselves of it (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-2-never-put-too-much-trust-in-friends-learn-how-to-use-enemies&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-13-when-asking-for-help-appeal-to-peoples-self-interest-never-to-their-mercy-or-gratitude&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Beware of envy (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-1-never-outshine-the-master&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-2-never-put-too-much-trust-in-friends-learn-how-to-use-enemies&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-46-never-appear-too-perfect&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Scarcity makes things more desirable – people want what they can’t have (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-16-use-absence-to-increase-respect-and-honor&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;People are conservative and don’t like a lot of change (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-45-preach-the-need-for-change-but-never-reform-too-much-at-once&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Humans are affected by the moods and attitudes of those around us (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-10-infection-avoid-the-unhappy-and-unlucky&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;In some groups, power is concentrated in the hands of a few (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-42-strike-the-shepherd-and-the-sheep-will-scatter&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Distracting others gives you room to operate (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-6-court-attention-at-all-costs&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-12-use-selective-honesty-and-generosity-to-disarm-your-victim&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-37-create-compelling-spectacles&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-44-disarm-and-infuriate-with-the-mirror-effect&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Appearances matter, sometimes more than reality (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-5-so-much-depends-on-reputation-guard-it-with-your-life&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You can gain power by being or looking competent (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-7-get-others-to-do-the-work-for-you-but-always-take-the-credit&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-11-learn-to-keep-people-dependent-on-you&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-26-keep-your-hands-clean&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-30-make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;), mysterious (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-3-conceal-your-intentions&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-4-always-say-less-than-necessary&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-6-court-attention-at-all-costs&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-16-use-absence-to-increase-respect-and-honor&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-17-keep-others-in-suspended-terror-cultivate-an-air-of-unpredictability&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;), regal and “above the fray” (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-34-be-royal-in-your-own-fashion-act-like-a-king-to-be-treated-like-one&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-36-disdain-things-you-cannot-have-ignoring-them-is-the-best-revenge&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;You may look weak by getting angry or emotional over things you can’t have (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-36-disdain-things-you-cannot-have-ignoring-them-is-the-best-revenge&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;) or being compared to someone greater than you (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-41-avoid-stepping-into-a-great-mans-shoes&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;There are disadvantages to looking too powerful or perfect, as it&lt;br&gt;could make others see you as a threat or “out of touch” (Laws &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-1-never-outshine-the-master&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-18-do-not-build-fortresses-to-protect-yourself-isolation-is-dangerous&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-46-never-appear-too-perfect&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;). It may sometimes be better to look weak so that others underestimate you (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-21-play-a-sucker-to-catch-a-sucker-seem-dumber-than-your-mark&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-22-use-the-surrender-tactic-transform-weakness-into-power&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Sometimes it is good to stick out (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-6-court-attention-at-all-costs&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-37-create-compelling-spectacles&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;); other times it’s better to blend in (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-3-conceal-your-intentions&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-38-think-as-you-like-but-behave-like-others&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-44-disarm-and-infuriate-with-the-mirror-effect&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Information is important.&lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Get information about others, particularly their weaknesses (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-14-pose-as-a-friend-work-as-a-spy&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-18-do-not-build-fortresses-to-protect-yourself-isolation-is-dangerous&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-19-know-who-youre-dealing-with-do-not-offend-the-wrong-person&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-33-discover-each-mans-thumbscrew&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Don’t reveal too much about yourself (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-3-conceal-your-intentions&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-4-always-say-less-than-necessary&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-17-keep-others-in-suspended-terror-cultivate-an-air-of-unpredictability&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Make plans and think through different permutations (Law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-29-plan-all-the-way-to-the-end&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;) but also be adaptable (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-20-do-not-commit-to-anyone&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-24-play-the-perfect-courtier&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-38-think-as-you-like-but-behave-like-others&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-44-disarm-and-infuriate-with-the-mirror-effect&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-48-assume-formlessness&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Direct, rather than react (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-8-make-other-people-come-to-you-use-bait-if-necessary&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-25-re-create-yourself&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-28-enter-action-with-boldness&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-31-control-the-options-get-others-to-play-with-the-cards-you-deal&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Disrupt others’ plans (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-8-make-other-people-come-to-you-use-bait-if-necessary&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-28-enter-action-with-boldness&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-39-stir-up-waters-to-catch-fish&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Be patient and play the long game (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-22-use-the-surrender-tactic-transform-weakness-into-power&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-29-plan-all-the-way-to-the-end&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-35-master-the-art-of-timing&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Be rational, not emotional (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-2-never-put-too-much-trust-in-friends-learn-how-to-use-enemies&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-39-stir-up-waters-to-catch-fish&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-47-do-not-go-past-the-mark-you-aimed-for-in-victory-learn-when-to-stop&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;). Don’t get distracted (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-36-disdain-things-you-cannot-have-ignoring-them-is-the-best-revenge&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-40-despise-the-free-lunch&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Power sometimes requires a big show of force (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-15-crush-your-enemy-totally&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-23-concentrate-your-forces&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-28-enter-action-with-boldness&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;) but usually, it is better to be subtle and indirect (Laws &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-11-learn-to-keep-people-dependent-on-you&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-24-play-the-perfect-courtier&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-31-control-the-options-get-others-to-play-with-the-cards-you-deal&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-43-work-on-the-hearts-and-minds-of-others&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tosummarise.com/detailed-summary-the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/#law-44-disarm-and-infuriate-with-the-mirror-effect&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
💡 There is no secret WhatsApp group where executives, product leaders and investors are trying to work out how to keep designers away from setting long-term strategy and creating ambitious visions of the future. We are doing that to ourselves.

&lt;p&gt;Dan Mall says &lt;a href=&quot;https://danmall.com/posts/move-authority-to-the-information/&quot;&gt;Move Authority to the Information&lt;/a&gt;. Give people on the ground the authority to make decisions.  “Don’t take control; give control.” 🫡&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cultivate a habit of small acts of sedition. Making little paper cuts in the flesh of the beast which add up over time. You can&#39;t stop the machine by yourself, but you can sure as hell throw sand in its gears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t remember where I came across this, but it resonated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core Principles of Radical Honesty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying is the primary cause of suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living honestly is the antidote to lying and the root of its power is in distinguishing &lt;em&gt;noticing&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;. You can only &lt;em&gt;notice&lt;/em&gt; in the moment. And you can only notice three categories of things: sensations, thoughts, and your external surroundings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing honestly what you notice frees you from the suffering caused by attachment to lying, withholding, phoniness, and ideals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing honestly what you notice also deepens love, connection, understanding and forgiveness (eventually).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radical Honesty is a living, walking, talking out-loud meditation that moves you from reactivity to being a creator of your own life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 minute documentary called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campfire-stories.org/the-shoe-shop&quot;&gt;The Shoe Shop&lt;/a&gt;. Toward the end, Dougald Hine suggests that the compounding crises of our time are asking us to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;see ourselves as creatures that can be part of the on-going-ness of the world. That making scars is not all we’re good for. That scars heal over time. That we have been, and can yet be again, a part of the process by which forests live in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorized poem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”When despair for the world grows in me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and I wake in the night at the least sound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I go and lie down where the wood drake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I come into the peace of wild things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;who do not tax their lives with forethought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;of grief. I come into the presence of still water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I feel above me the day-blind stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;waiting with their light. For a time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-tags=&quot;Ideas Gift&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying the continuing conversation between Adam Wilson and Sam Bliss, kicked off in a series called “The Anarchist and the Animist” &lt;a href=&quot;https://peasantryschool.substack.com/p/radical-hospitality&quot;&gt;Adam’s newsletter&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. The podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.micaylajean.com/the-podcast&quot;&gt;Finding Wilder&lt;/a&gt; had them both on discussing the gift economy where the two “have a few stories worth telling about the magic that happens when food is turned back into a gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes on the pod:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative Terms for “Gift Economy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reckless Generosity: A proactive and unconditional giving without calculation of return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voluntary Impoverishment: The inverse of above. Of course no one likes how that feels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radical Hospitality: The generous and welcoming nature of the natural world. Adam’s “translation of what the landscaping is doing”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paradox of Open Giving: There’s an observation that when one adopts a stance of complete generosity—“people have free reign to take what they want from me”—the expected outcome of being depleted does not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prerequisite of Worthiness for Receiving: To be able to accept profound gifts from others—especially those that cannot be repaid—a person must possess a “multitude of worthiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of “Old Sally,” who, after injuring her leg, had her cows milked by neighbors for six weeks. This illustrates a community’s response to a member deemed worthy of such a non-transactional gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Call to Community: A central theme is a deep “longing for community” and belonging. This longing is framed not as a response to an absence, but as a recognition of the potential for community that is “around us everywhere.” The core action is to work “against the forces that will make us all strangers to one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidance from the “Non-Human”: There is a spiritual or ecological dimension suggesting that “the non-humans are asking us is to focus on how we treat each others as humans.” This also involves embracing a “non-professional way” of doing things, valuing authentic human connection over polished expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

    Been digging deep into observational, documentary, street photography. It took me a while to figure out the aesthetic I was after. I landed on:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos of built environments; quiet shadows on buildings, mundane and overlooked subjects, architectural details, the interplay of light and shadow emphasizing abstraction and geometry, and mood over human presence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We need to confront honestly the issue of scale. Bigness has a charm and a drama that are seductive, especially to politicians and financiers; but bigness promotes greed, indifference, and damage, and often bigness is not necessary. You may need a large corporation to run an airline or to manufacture cars, but you don&#39;t need a large corporation to raise a chicken or a hog. You don&#39;t need a large corporation to process local food or local timber and market it locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;If you want your meetings to be more effective, and ultimate contribute to the bottom line of your business, then introduce healthy conflict within a light weight structure. Let the attendees emotion be the driving energy behind good decisions and business success.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I usually practice out loud on and off for a day or two before hand. Once I’m in the meeting I will be freer to speak because as I interact, it will just flow, and I will be able to a adjust as I go, because I’ve heard how it comes across in my practice times.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Once you have spoken at meetings, leading a conversation actually becomes easy, and in fact, too easy.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning is the scream. We scream. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When we write or when we read, it is easy to forget that the beginning is not the word, but the scream. Faced with the mutilation of human lives by capitalism, a scream of sadness, a scream of horror, a scream of anger, a scream of refusal: NO.

&lt;p&gt;Nice story of the disruptor-elite class and their shackles to their world that are only breakable when they personally witness the systems falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most poignant part: when the black woman started breaking the glass sculptures, everyone was OK with it. some even cheered her on. most elite were fine with it. then the lower elite class started breaking them and had fun and the leader didn’t care. then the woman took it further and the lowers stopped, aghast. the breaking point was the mona lisa. not sure what it signified, but it was the last sacred thing to these people.&lt;/p&gt;

Loved this idea that a local farmers market offers a cider press. You bring your own apples. Those presses are beasts and make sense to share.

&lt;p&gt;My family and I care for a 800 square feet garden in San Francisco’s Mission District. Planning started in 2015 and we finally planted in January 2017. The process involved tearing up concrete, pouring a new sidewalk, hauling in clean soil, and patiently waiting for the wet season to plant.

Instead, we have access only to the content that can be readily and easily monetised, trapped in garish and unreliable platforms. There’s no guarantee your favourite movie will still be streaming next month. It feels as if the internet’s vast early possibility has shrunk.”

&lt;h1&gt;Red Team Blues&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Cory Doctorow  • Published: 2023&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture class=&quot;cover&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second in the Martin Hench series. This one is set in modern times and follows the classic trope of the aging detective (forensic accountant in this case) pulled in to do one last job before retirement. He’s a world-weary techie who is tasked with recovering crypto keys. Doctorow touches on tech ethics, cybercrime, and the inseparability of ruthless violence from the world of finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words &amp;amp; phrases earmarked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift pod&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“a legendarily, easy to assemble shelter I associate with burning man types. I’d run into a campgrounds.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“…the shelter, the futuristic, silver foil thing with quilted walls and circular, zip out port holes, as well as a fabric vestibule.” p.39&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmospheric river:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;“a narrow corridor or filament of concentrated water vapor transported in the atmosphere. It’s like a river in the sky that can be 1,000 miles long.“&lt;/em&gt; Atmospheric river floods: It’s the &lt;em&gt;“consecutive atmospheric rivers, known as AR families, can cause significant flooding.”&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/what-is-an-atmospheric-river-a-hydrologist-explains-the-good-the-bad-and-how-theyre-changing&quot;&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faraday bag&lt;/strong&gt;: a way to make your phone untraceable. No signals can enter or leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WeTip&lt;/strong&gt;: a fully anonymous way to report a crime online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red/blue team:&lt;/strong&gt; in cybersecurity, they both work together to simulate attacks and defenses. The red team is on offense and exploits vulnerabilities. The blue team defends by analyzing attacks, responding to incidents, and planning to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilettante&lt;/strong&gt;: someone who seems interested in many subjects, but doesn’t know much about any of them; without real commitment or knowledge. “I’ve always been a dilettante, 10 miles wide and 1 inch deep” p.103 I felt seen after knowing this word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cult of the Dead Cow:&lt;/strong&gt; a hacking collective working to protect user privacy and security that started in the 1980s. Some of their achievements: invented the term “hacktivism,” contributed to the development of Tor, and significantly influenced modern cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated License Plate Recognition&lt;/strong&gt; (ALPR) services: private companies who collect image photos or videos of cars from public spaces and extract license numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sources could be their own cameras or city-owned traffic cameras and private surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the us, no federal law regulates ALPR technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All this constant surveillance poses serious privacy concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep eludes me because I am fraught. The compartments, I once housed my work in while I slumbered have long rotted away. Everything mixes now, the greatest hits real of my worries, my fears, my regrets. Those those most of all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Public library was the first public library branch in the country to hire a full-time social worker.”  p. 162 This was in 2009 and the role had a focus on the local homeless population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctorow is smart and has a great conversational tone to teach us about tech without being bro-ey. His characters are flat though. There’s little feeling or emotionality as they see horrid scenes or participate in love scenes. The lead, the accountant, never misses a perfect comeback and is icy like 007. He actually has no flaws come to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned &lt;strong&gt;plot armor&lt;/strong&gt; through reading other critiques of the book. Wherein a fictional character is preserved from harm due to their necessity for the plot to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second Doctorow work. I immediatly ordered two more from the library after finishing this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, For the Win (2010), was a lesson in labor rights and exploitation in the digital age. It sat upon  fiction about “gold farmers”—low-wage workers from developing countries, who were hired to play online games to earn currency for wealthier players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one followed a similar format. The underlying non-fiction piece here is on profit-prisons and frauds. The fiction is a noir, following a tough accountant going up against a capitalist system that continues to more cleverly extract money from the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there was so much to chew on, I thought I’d share a list of things I looking up while reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ponzi scheme&lt;/strong&gt;: use new investors’ money to pay returns to earlier ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pyramid scheme&lt;/strong&gt;: rely on recruiting new members, with payouts depending on expanding levels of recruits.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downline&lt;/strong&gt;: People below you in the recruitment or sales chain. So, if you recruit three people into the program, those three are part of your downline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upline&lt;/strong&gt;: People above you who recruited you into the system. Your sales contribute to the earnings of everyone higher up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finance stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junk fees&lt;/strong&gt;: hidden or unexpected charges added often without clear explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bezzle&lt;/strong&gt;: The period of the con when it has started and the future seems bright and prosperous to those who have invested. The jig isn’t up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private equity&lt;/strong&gt;: a form of investment where funds are directly invested into private companies, or where investors buy out public companies to take them private. They can fix companies, but can also hurt them if they focus only on making money quickly (which, of course money is a major focus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venture Capital&lt;/strong&gt;: a type of private equity in early-stage investments in startups with high growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private–equity–funded “roll up.”&lt;/strong&gt; An example is private equity firms buying up multiple nursing homes, “rolling them up” into a larger organization, and then flipping them for profit. A famous case happened in 2007, when this book took place. HCR ManorCare declined in care quality for a decade and went bankrupt, while the firm Carlyle Group made bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grab bag of companies”, “a rat king made of jealous, bickering companies, all vine to dominate each other and the public at the same time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PACER&lt;/strong&gt; (Public Access to Court Electronic Records): is how the public accesses U.S. federal court documents and case information. It launched as a free service, but is now paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECAP&lt;/strong&gt; (REtrieve the CAPtured documents): is an open-source project designed to open up these documents that are leagally within the public domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cali’s private prisons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80s&lt;/strong&gt;: overcrowding begins due to tough-on-crime policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90s&lt;/strong&gt;: private prisons introduced to make more space for inmates. Even harsher crime policy cranks up the numbers more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2000s&lt;/strong&gt;: Prisons at 200% capacity. Lawsuits filed about inhumane conditions and inadequate healthcare for inmates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010s&lt;/strong&gt;: Supreme Court orders Cali to reduce, but their citizens aren’t warm to the idea of roaming ex-inmates, so the state does little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;: They’re down to only 126% capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America will never make life better for the millions of souls it has imprisoned. Never. It is not in our character. To be an American is to live with the festering background knowledge that you are in a land that imprisons more of its people than any country in the history of the world–a land with more prisoners than Stalin’s USSR or Hu Jintao’s China or P. W. Botha’s Apartheid South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guard vs financier psychology&lt;/strong&gt;: Financiers, and those within that world, end up being more cruel to the inmates than the prison guards. Why?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance, making dehumanization easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different incentives. Financiers are rewarded for squeezing maximum value out of every transaction, even if it harms the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science suppresion&lt;/strong&gt;: thousands of studies on over 40k patients showed extremenly promising results on LSD improvong mental health conditions like addiction, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. The rise of its use into counterculture movements lead to criminalization and heightened drug propaganda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free drugs&lt;/strong&gt;: Once you’re connected to the right people, especially around older hippie enthusiasts, sometimes the drugs are free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while the whole sound drug distribution networks were controlled by dangerous, organized criminals, the actual production side was often just some semiretired hobbiest engineer with a lab in their garage, who produced so much quantity so cheaply, that selling to anyone, except those wholesalers made no sense. The cartels paid cash. Pals got freebies…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cali&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAPD neo-Nazi police gangs&lt;/strong&gt;: are a thing, and their “998” tattoos which indicate an officer has shot someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalina Island:&lt;/strong&gt; small island 22 miles from LA
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Wrigley Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;, the chewing gum magnate, bought it in 1919
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His money came the typical way; shrewdness, which lead him to buy up 95% of the world’s chicle tree forests. Anyone would now need to go through him to make gum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He bought the Chicago Cubs and they went there for spring training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDT filled&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the deepest channels off any coast. Sits there is tens of thousands of barrels of the toxic pesticide. Someday they will all leak and kill all life around it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/&quot;&gt;Sweet exposé&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only critique is that somse of the main characters came off as a little flat. I cannot comprehend how our main guy Marty displayed no remorse for being solely responsible for putting his friend in prison for 25 years. At no point did he offer an apology or even narrate to the reader that he was indeed to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

      <title>Chicken grief</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens%20update/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;&lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Aug 7, 2024&quot;&gt;Aug 7, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chicken grief&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big update since the last post. We got chicks which don’t look like chicks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acclimating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant four weeks of having them grow and chirp and poop in the house, which unfortunately aligned with having guests three out of four of those weeks. The final week we put them in the mobile coop in the garage protected from the evening chill. Spring is when your winter dreams are realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some tragic chick deaths and another run to tractor supply, we ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 buff orpingtons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 black marans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 gold laced wyandotte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens%20update/img/chicks-inside.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens%20update/img/chicks-inside.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens%20update/img/chicks-inside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6 week old chickens in a box&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The six survivors under their heatlamp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked them up from TS twelve weeks ago when they were one week old. Now they’re thirteen weeks and self sufficient. They enter their coop at night. They know the yard and appear not to stray beyond our boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we’ve discovered that one of the wyandotte’s is a rooster. So, we’ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final updates to the coop before rolling it out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painted the floor with some leftover deck paint we had. After hemming and hawing about what to do for a surface for the interior, and never ending up finding a properly sized rubber mat in the marketplaces, I leaned on what was lying around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used hardware cloth with big washers to secure the open holes for ventilation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attached the roof. It ended up being a pain because I didn’t account for overhang. One sheet of 8‘ x 4‘ metal corrugated wasn’t enough for more than 2 inches of overhang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went with an automatic door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Interior, free of poo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer is fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now though, I’ve become used to them being around and slowly transforming into a chicken-person. I turn off the fence in the mornings and open it for them to roam (an automating opportunity.) I try to remember to feed them before starting on work. Then I close it in the evenings when they’ve cooped themselves and turn it back on. I  experiement with what scraps they’ll eat and what organics can skip the path to compost. I lean on neighors when we want to go away. I like having them around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Chickens, part 2</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v2/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;&lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Feb 28, 2024&quot;&gt;Feb 28, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chickens, part 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chipping away at the coop, one month in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More wood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cedar was great, but it felt thick at 1&amp;quot;-1.5&amp;quot; wide and might make the chickshaw heavy to do the whole thing from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aside--right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v2/img/resawing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v2/img/resawing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A bandsaw cutting a wide piece of wood&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Turns out, resawing is easier with a sawmill&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered cutting it down to have 1/2&amp;quot; boards for the sides and bottom. “Resawing” it, they call it. As in, sawing-again, after the sawmill did its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inherited a band saw a few years ago but I feel inept when behind it. Even if i wasn’t, resawing like this is slow and uneven. It can also be done with a table saw, which I don’t have yet, and with a circular or hand saw, but neither of those looked like fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a craigslist post labeled &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Rough cut hemlock framing.”&lt;/strong&gt; He had 8&amp;quot; x 1&amp;quot; boards available.&lt;/em&gt; I asked if he’d be willing to cut them down to 1/2&amp;quot; and he agreed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t even charge for the extra cuts so in total they came out to 50 cents per board foot. And were sourced from local trees, so that was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pieces were gigantic at 16’ for my little SUV, but I got them home without breaking the roof or having them fly off. After arranging them by my chop saw in my 17’ garage, I cut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I overestimated on both the cedar and hemlock, but this building stuff is fun. I’m happy to have extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get waterproof, cleanable flooring.&lt;/strong&gt; I probably don&#39;t need this but it&#39;s been recommended, as this floor won&#39;t easily come out. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure roofing.&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&#39;t think this one through. with the box being 4&#39; x 4&#39;, I thought one 8&#39; x 4&#39; metal roofing panel would do, but nope. This didn&#39;t account for overlapping the panels and for overhang we&#39;ll want on each side.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get hardware cloth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Chickens, part 1</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;&lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Feb 8, 2024&quot;&gt;Feb 8, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chickens, part 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we don’t have them yet. This post intends to show the progress we’ve made. And I’ve always wanted to try the blogging techniques of writing as you go. Learning live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So. Chickens.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been 6 months since the idea started to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s felt pretty abstract and nerve-wracking from the start, but now that my nose has been in books and we have some supplies, it’s getting real. The anxiety is dimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why subject our pure family to these miscreants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach the kids (and parents) about responsibility and I’m sure much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take more control of our families food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t grow up on a farm. Like those who don’t have hunters or military folk in the family, it felt far-away. A distant thing other people did, but not us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here we are. Ever since buying a house on an acre, by a small river in late 2020, I’ve settling into the idea of permaculture. The previous owner helped push me down this path too by leaving legacy blueberries, an apple tree, and some raspberry rows. I’ve managed not to kill them and planted more trees and berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chickens seems like a logical next step homesteaders take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system.
    &lt;cite&gt;Bill Mollison, permaculture&#39;s papa&lt;/cite&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step I tend to spend far too much time on. Surfing the webs and watching farm videos is safe. However, this felt different than getting lost in the research blackhole than other projects because there was commitment. I’ve told people about the plan. My wife is in. The kids are pumped and we’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, I picked up a book from the free library in the town hall. It ended up being one beginner poultry folk consider a staple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/img/fresh-eggs-daily.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Fresh Eggs Daily, by Steele, Lisa.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ordered a slew of library books. One was chapter book for my 6 year old which is turning out to be great poultry propaganda. None of the others brought much new to the convo than I already gathered from blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/img/chicken-books.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/img/chicken-books.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/img/chicken-books.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4 titles: Unusual chickens for the exceptional poultry farmer, Living with chickens, Chicken tractor, Chicken coops.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;4 library books&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sites have been helpful bookmarks thus far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://practicalselfreliance.com/raising-chickens&quot;&gt;Practical Self Reliance: How To Raise Chickens&lt;/a&gt;: Gave it an honest view of the sacrifices it requires. From a Vermonters perspective.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backyardchickens.com/&quot;&gt;Backyard Chickens&lt;/a&gt;: The most popular community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens&quot;&gt;Chicken reddit&lt;/a&gt;: Second most popular chicken hangout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was january and I set my focus on shelter and early supplies. Intermediary choices like chicken breeds could wait. My first decision was deciding to refer to as the Coup coop. In true permaculture fashion of minimizing inputs, I sought out used materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thriftiness or being cheap, as my friends called it, was built into my bones. I’ve been buying used since before it was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local wins so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;someone offered their beginner chicken supplies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;milk crates from hanniford grocery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware like hinges and knobs from restore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wheels from marketplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cedar cutoffs in St. Albans lumber yard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 inch spruce planks from our small Underhill saw-mill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choosing the ChickSaw&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re researching small coops, you’ll inevitably stumble upon Justin Rhodes’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://abundantpermaculture.com/mobile-chicken-coop/&quot;&gt;ChickSaw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The romantic I am fell fast for its promise. It’s mobile, is low-maintenance, has instructions, has many followers, and is cheap! When I settled down, I became weary about the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big benefit is not needing to clean the floor because the poops fall through the 1-inch square hardware cloth – fertilizing the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the mink tracks by our river came to mind and those 1-inch holes started to seem roomy. Other folks have voiced similar concerns in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to play it safe. Being my first go at this whole farming thing and that there’s a steady flow of posts on our local forum about quitting chickening because of various vermin, I opted for a tight coop with an electric fence around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChickShaw variations I liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starandsparrow.com/journal/going-mobile&quot;&gt;A more wood-based design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw2mp0eYmdU&quot;&gt;Video of other improvements&lt;/a&gt;, including a door to protect the milk crates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drawings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of drawings and exploration. Here’s a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;What we landed on&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept a lot from the ChickSaw. It’s still a 4x4 box, but instead of being 2 feet tall, it’s 2 on one end and 3 feet on the other. Considering the snow, I didn’t love the flat top. It still opens for easy access. There will be 2 wheels and I still need to figure a handle to move the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The cedar frame&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the cedar craigslist location, I filled my my family-sized SUV up until it couldn’t fit anymore and headed to my dad’s to borrow his table saw. Then I ripped about four armfuls of 2x6es and 2x8ers down to 2x4s, 2x3s, and 2x1s. Fed up with planning, I began.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Getting three-dimensional
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry of creatures led me to buy to go down the route of the electric fence. I went with the tallest one possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How many&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to shoot for 4 or 5 birds. I think the coop is big enough that during the winter they could live there for an extended time. For 4 birds, they’d get 4 square feet each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time winter comes around again, I may add a small outdoor run. As I walk around town, I see many neighbors have one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grazing method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;aside--right&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/chickens-v1/img/rotational-grazing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Only imagine the cows are chickens. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/international/topic/rotational-grazing-climate-resilience&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going with the rotational paddocks strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve avoided mowing certain areas of the yard for the past couple of years and I’m curious to see what they will do in the tall grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many young trees in the ground which are protected from deer already. Hopefully they’re also poultry-proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is free-range. Our plot is sandwiched between two neighbor fences on either side. I’d like to test what happens when we open them to the full yard. One side, however, has some rowdy pups, which an electric fence would protect against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going all out with this coop structure, yet I’m hesitant to invest in gadgetry too early. It’s a character trait like my thriftiness. The automatic chicken door is a-calling, but I feel it’s only proper to see what it’s like without it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly see the value of automation, you should understand the problem through experience first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Hackday 2023 - automating accessbility within our CMS</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;
    &lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Nov 4, 2023&quot;&gt;Written: Nov 4, 2023 | Updated: Dec 18, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hackday 2023: &lt;span&gt;automating accessbility within our CMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the results from a cross-team collab session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Hat website marketing group hosted a hacktoberfest in 2023. About 25 people signed up and we broke into five teams each. It’s inspired by an agency we look up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.com/about/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus this year was unsurprisingly on how to leverage AI and automation to achieve our goals. My team rallied around automating accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem: lots o pages, lots o accessibility fails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to focus on automating accessibility work. Starting with developers as an audience but laying a foundation for design and content teams. Our site(s) face accessibility challenges across thousands of pages, with varying issues. While our industry recognizes automation can’t solve all accessibility issues, it can solve &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tooling to score live pages, but nothing for checking unpublished ones. Nor do we have anything scalable to check against our internally adopted accessibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our idea: An automated tool that checks accessibility compliance &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they’re published to the site.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more spreadsheets (we use one for every project now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View a page’s accessibility score easily (see previous item)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS as a single source of truth for page-accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serves all three focus areas (design, dev, content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually could supports progressive completion via the waterfall workflow (ex. starts in Figma and is at 55/100 items, and when finally ready to publish by a content strategist/publisher is at 95/100.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue creating and resolving log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each page on the website would have an “accessibility page health” page. This would allow anybody with access to the CMS to pop in and monitor accessibility. They could also sort all the pages based on the numerical number of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- &lt;source srcset=&quot;img/cms-scorecard.webp&quot;  type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt; --&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating the items into human and non-human buckets is a key feature. See the subjective section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- &lt;source srcset=&quot;img/cms-scorecard-2.webp&quot;  type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt; --&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-2.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While editing, the tool will constantly check itself against our standards. There will be a dedicated widget alerting the editor if any change they made breaks a guideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;!-- &lt;source srcset=&quot;img/cms-scorecard-3.webp&quot;  type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt; --&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-3.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget was based on similar small-spaced solutions linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;!-- &lt;source srcset=&quot;img/cms-scorecard-4.webp&quot;  type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt; --&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-4.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/hack-day-2023/img/cms-scorecard-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget allows you to locate the offenders directly on the editor page, and also explore more to learn why its offending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Figma checks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to applying the idea to the designers’ workflow. But the work on the widget above could be rebuilt and applied to a Figma plug-in that had a similar UX and UI. Some parts of it, like color contrast and spacing, we could automate, and the other half would be a checklist. In this case, Figma would be the source of truth for design accessibility health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widget was influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/&quot;&gt;Deque Axe devtools browser extenstion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/ckeditor-accessibility-auditor&quot;&gt;Drupal CKEditor Accessibility Auditor&lt;/a&gt;, as they already had fantastically similar solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing vision work like this has long-term effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second hack-esque event and it was a blast. You get to exercise your ability to dream beyond constraints in ways that aren’t possible in daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I was thinking about how valuable a research-based analyst would be. Someone dedicated to tracking updates based on research would be ideal. We lack a way to measure how much research truly moves the needle…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time in vision-land, jolted this idea alive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/article&gt;
        &lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;popover&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Barefoot Gen: A Cartoon Story of Hiroshima&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Originally this was a series of comic books published first in Japan, then translated to in english. My first manga. I stumbled on it while visiting a friend, going through a stack of their dad’s old radical comics, and read the whole thing aggressively. When done, I sat there stunned, wondering what I just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It’s a model for the non-fiction, memoir graphic novel genre. It felt real. It felt true. The art aligned with the story.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I was transported before and after the bombing of Hiroshima. And saw it through the innocent eyes of a six-year-old boy, Gen. He&#39;s the son of a dissenter. The pro-war propaganda was the air the Japanese people breathed. Because of this, the family are ostracized and deprived of community, save for a Korean family who receives much discrimination and also struggles to assimilate.&lt;/p&gt;
             &lt;figure&gt;
                &lt;picture&gt;
                    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/non-fiction-comics/img/barefoot-gen-snippet.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/non-fiction-comics/img/barefoot-gen-snippet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot gen page with the two brothers wanting to support their family during war.&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption&gt;Snippet from book 1 of 10&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/picture&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The propaganda part fascinated me. It illustrated how an entire society was mobilized for the war effort to the extent that families guarded each grain of rice with rage. For families like Gen&#39;s labeled as traitors, asking friends for extra food meant putting those friends at risk of being labeled traitors themselves. Dissenting meant starving. Gen’s older brother tries to restore his families honor by joining the army.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The story is told matter-of-factly with no sense of preachiness. The authors objectiveness is startling and exemplifies his character.
            While the illustrations are fairly simple compared to others I&#39;ve encountered, they are still captivating, creating an immersive world. Whatever their low level of detail is evened out by the choked detail of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not brave enough to watch the movie version.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For not having many words, at 80 pages with huge panels, the sources section is immense. think this is due to footnoting many actual quotes into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;it gets at the feeling of surviving, what seemed like, an end-of-days happening.&lt;/p&gt;

            Graphic novel of the polish-born radical.

            We should not allow conservative interpretations of the Revolutionary War to overshadow these radical histories of July 4. The meaning of the Fourth of July encompasses all these struggles for independence waged by citizens, slaves, colonial subjects, union leaders, and philosophers. 

            If the Revolution is about resisting inequality and struggling for freedom, not just celebrating something that happened long ago, then we should look to the [People’s Bicentennial Commission (PBC)](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/4/28/the-peoples-bicentennial-commission-pif-you/) as an alternative to the populist patriotism of the Tea Party. https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/146753

      <title>Revamping 2 local logos</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Revamping 2 local logos &lt;span&gt;without their consent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to summarize what goes into giving a brand a refresh, but I didn’t have it written down. I hadn’t cataloged the process during any actual projects. So I set out to pump some life into 2 local logos to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose businesses who’s signs I drive by often. They could each use some love / have many opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases we’re talking about logos on signs, so part of this is work designing a sign. However the expression of a brand on a sign is going to be similar to a brand on any other medium. It’s thinking about who’s looking at it and what they need at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My message here is: many undervalue branding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is often seen as if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.&amp;quot; True, word-of-mouth is still the most potent way to spread the word. Good work really does speak for itself. But here’s the catch: new customers who don’t know your company and its reputation only see the old sign outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while word-of-mouth is great, marketing is about inviting others in. Maintaining your brand helps you connect with new customers and create lasting bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When logos look old and worn out, it tells people the company and its service might be wearing out too. But when logos are fresh and clear, it shows that you’re still in the game and here for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logo 1: Creative Gardens &amp;amp; Nursery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re on a busy street I pass every time I need to drive pretty much anywhere. They’re great. I’ve put many of their plants in my yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/existing-cgn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A smattering of image search results for a nursery company&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Logo signs from the road&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess current brand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not sure about that mountain imagery.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s ubiquitous in Vermont and thus becomes invisible, not making you stand out. It it also loses points because it doesn’t have anything to do with the name or the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downplay phone number.&lt;/strong&gt; Not as important as it was 10+ years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize for drivers.&lt;/strong&gt; Lay out the information so a driver-by going 40mph can digest it. They are the audience in this situation and the goal of the sign is to be memorable, so when the interested driver gets on their laptop, they can look the company up by name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more character to fonts&lt;/strong&gt;. Since it’s all about creativity, why not make them look a bit more imaginative? Consider something earthy, but not too playful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the signs match.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently both road-facing signs use different styling which is probably confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore other names for business.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t explain what they do and is a bit bland (and out of scope.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get familiar with the landscape and because I have no available owner to ask, I searched “nursery logo” on the popular designer-hangout &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/search/shots/popular/branding?q=nursery%20logo&quot;&gt;dribbble&lt;/a&gt;. I review these results with a grain of salt because they’re not representative of live projects – they’re ideas that may be asking for critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/dribbble-cgn.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/dribbble-cgn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dribbble branding research for a nursery company&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How do others solve this?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move from ideas to the real, I searched the web for images using &amp;quot;Vermont nursery logos&amp;quot;and came up with these. They come from the top performing sites in this industry in our state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/google-cgn.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/google-cgn.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/google-cgn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A smattering of image search results for a nursery company&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How do actual companies in this space solve this?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these, I notice plant imagery, greens and browns, and fonts with a personality. Some are designed to be read from a distance more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dive into the design software. First, I separate the text from the existing design to work on it separately. I begin by exploring various fonts, sticking to open-source ones that can be used commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the layout goes hand-in-hand with the font selection. I ask myself, how can the elements work harmoniously together? What should be given priority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I move on to imagery. Is it necessary, or can we make better use of the mountain image we already have? Is there something more relevant that can be used instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I approach the color scheme. It’s essential for the design to look good in black and white as well. I prefer to add colors in the end since they can sometimes distract from the overall design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Exploring fonts, layouts, and images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: when preparing the result image, I checked their site and realized their company name is different than the signs. 🤦🏼‍♂️ Yet, another reason to revamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are options for many applications here, one without the 5 words from the primary logo. If needed, an icon-only version could be used. The yellow, green, and plant would be recognizable on its own if the other version’s impact sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How I solved for this&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logo 2: Joe’s Snack Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a great location on a sharp bend and have been doing their thing for 70 years. Incredible. In our town, they’re the greasy drive-in diner with cheap prices. We’re grateful to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-existing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-existing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-existing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3 signs: one printed on the entrance of the building, one tall one by the road, and one by a lower parking lot.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt; 
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Three signs in three different font styles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assess current brand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have use different text on their signs and different variations of words too. On their menu, they use “Joe’s Drive-in Snack Bar,” which embeds a retro-feel with text. It was probably something they used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean hard into a mid-century feel.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve learned retro brands resonate from my working on brands of plumbers and HVAC companies that are second and third generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pepsi?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s on many of their signage, but feels outdated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seemingly important bits&lt;/strong&gt;: that they offer creemees and the established date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider exposing what a snack bar is.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it obvious what’s available at a snack bar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else do I need to know about Joe’s? I scrour around and find more signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-research.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-research.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joe’s menu, a rooftop sign, and a neon sign.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How else has this name been expressed?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head over to dribbble and see some inspiring implementations of the mid-century design spirit pared with charming phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-dribbble.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How do others solve this?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a web-search of “vermont diner logo” reveals some restaurants I’m familiar with, but nothing too relevant to our project needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How do actual companies in this space solve this?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have enough to go on. Maybe too much. This style is popular and full of potential, and I’d love to dive deeper into it. Inspiration is flowing, but to stay focused, I’ve time-boxed myself. For an actual project, this would be a time to chat with the owner to help narrow the direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-brainstorm.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-brainstorm.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-brainstorm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from a design scratchpad containing 10s of different font selections and variaitions.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Pursuing a 1950’s aesthetic is a blast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end up being drawn to Americana colors. Nostalgia is what we’re aiming for, and I believe we have 3 perfect retro fonts to achieve that. The imagery shows the all-important soft-serve, and the supporting text emphasizes that it’s not just a snack bar but also serves lunch and dinner. The shape of the design takes inspiration from parking lot signs, adding to that retro vibe we’re going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s enough elements the brand can be oriented vertical, horizontal, or just with text. Digital or print ads will appreciate this versatility. The building signage is in good shape as it is, but updating it to match would unify the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
	&lt;picture&gt;
	 	&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-result.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-result.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/local-logos/img/joes-result.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My version of the logo plastered on their front building, parking sign, and road sign, with red white blue, retro fonts, and icecream clipart.&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/picture&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;How I solved for this&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, I have steps!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process to upgrade a logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery &amp;amp; strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assess the current brand to determine what working and what’s not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the client’s business, mission, target audience, and competitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn what elements of the brand are essential &lt;em&gt;(not applicable here)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarize myself with the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how other designers address branding in this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine brand messaging and tone of voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore fonts and imagery that fit the companies personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the logo and visual elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Refinement &lt;em&gt;(not applicable here)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present brand concepts for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate client feedback to refine concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Launch! &lt;em&gt;(not applicable here)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the new brand across various touchpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support in maintaining the brand over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear that a real logo project involves A LOT of talking with the owner. We want to ensure it communicates the right thing. With this blog post and project I skipped all that in order to give a truncated version of the high-level steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose here I would add in a call-to-action to you, reader. But, it’s summer and I’m not sure I have time for more freelance work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my drive to make things is sometimes stronger than the logic of planning. These fake logos got created somehow, didn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SO! 😁&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do reach out if you’d like to put some life and love into your old logo / sign.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcoming an orchard into the community</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/welcoming-an-orchard-into-the-community/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcoming a&lt;span&gt; community orchard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 6th, 2023, there’s an orchard at the Underhill town pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, calling it an orchard is a bit aspirational. There’s six apple trees, nine blueberries, and ten raspberries in the ground. Once they start producing, they’re up for grabs to anyone who comes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/welcoming-an-orchard-into-the-community/img/underhill-community-orchard-map-full.png&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/picture&gt;
		&lt;figcaption&gt;See full map with descriptions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s a public experiment of planting perennial fruit-givers on public land.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees and shrubs and fruit are visually unavoidable while folks are relaxing by the popular family swimming hole. My hope is the plants inspire conversation about why they were planted, local food insecurity, and how people can help. To continue imagining, it may even inspire folks to plant a their own which will boost the areas biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a physical connection point. Many locals in this town of Vermont are passionate about gardening and fruit trees, but much of that knowledge remains within the boundaries of property. I’m very much a part of the group that obsesses over my lawn and my 1 acre, but it’s knowledge-hoarding. Not dissimilar to every garage on the street stocking the same tools, same lawnmower, and same ladder. In our time and place of relative affluence, the potential for sharing is juicy ripe. The community orchard is tool sharing at the library. It’s the adorable used book houses that amass along roads. It may just coax those with nature-brains from their cozy nooks into the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my immediate visions for the project. A place to host knowledge-sharing workshops on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pruning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mulching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting growies from nibblers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grafting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A place to organize get-togethers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressing cider in the fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blueberry picking to prepare for the yearly blueberry festival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jam-jamboree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tree expert AMAs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruit and nut tree certification program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal yard/garden/orchard tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild neighborhood celebration with ferments made from the orchard!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the foundation is set. These activities just need a little nudge to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was what I brought to this project. I threw a humble nugget of initiative against the wall. I was, and still am, grateful that it stuck, that my pitch was accepted with open arms by two other fellow crew members. It as as if they were waiting, poised for a project like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here’s a summary of our process.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2022, the town of requests community submissions for what to do with our ARPA money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take my new interest in fruit trees and resilience and penned a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I hesitate. I almost send it to the town, but instead send it to John who manages the food-sharing shed to get some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He loves the idea and pushes for usurping the funding and doing it ourselves, embodying Rob Hopkins from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://transitionnetwork.org/about-the-movement&quot;&gt;transition town movement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we wait for governments, it will be too late. If we act as individuals, it will be too little. But if we act as communities, it might just be enough, and it might just be in time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define the model of specialists and generalists: Each plant gets a specialist who’ll be the go-to resource and provide strategy when needed, but they won’t have to do all the work. General volunteers will provide support, like watering or weeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fill out the group with volunteers and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adjust the proposal to focus on approval not funding and send to the select board and recreation committee, because they manage the pond park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, we get approval and some surprise funding support anyway. Plant orders are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 6th, Earth Day and Vermont’s annual Green-Up Day, we welcome the plants into our ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are in watering-mode. We assigned one of us to dump water from the pond onto each plant daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The buzz from this project has me thinking, what’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being a part of a project like this, the idea bees are indeed abuzz. The notion of a public spud spot has already taken root. Empty patches in town are calling out to have fruit trees planted on them. The challenge at hand is tending to the wee saplings and shrubs that need extra care right now, but we’re in good hands. Apples won’t produce for 3-5 years. Blueberries will be sooner, and raspberries sooner still, but planting is just the beginning. Trees teach patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sought out similar projects while researching for this one, I noticed each project was at a different stage of maturity. The Underhill community orchard is indeed young and in the &lt;em&gt;establishment phase&lt;/em&gt;. I found few that were in the &lt;em&gt;maturation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stewardship phase&lt;/em&gt;, where the ecosystem is self-sufficient and requires minimum human input. This is the dream. Most I found were only a few years old. The projects that come up on google may not be an accurate view of the landscape and may indicate the people undertaking such projects aren’t tech-savvy and don’t update their blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects do, however, share strikingly similar missions, like enhancing food security and access, promoting sustainability, ecological restoration, fostering community engagement, empowering folks to commune, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even more radical missions like planning for the collapse of outdated systems by creating living examples of resilient and climate-adaptive agricultural systems that can withstand extreme weather conditions. Or intending to heal the severed wound of community and connection with the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m here for all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’ll be in the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;

	  &lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Apr 30, 2023&quot;&gt;Apr 30, 2023&lt;/time&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;Andy Shauf plays Norm &lt;span&gt;during Spring 2023 in Vermont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

		&lt;figure&gt;
			&lt;picture class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/andy-shauf-plays-norm/img/andy-shauf-whole-band-higher-ground-burlington-2023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andy Shauf with the 5 players in his band playing Higher Ground in Burlington, VT, 4/2023&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/picture&gt;
				&lt;figcaption&gt;Andy crooning us Canadian-style at our beloved Higher Ground&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		&lt;/figure&gt;

		&lt;h3&gt;Every now and then my love for music narrows into obsession.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Andy Shauf was one of those lucky ones. It was hearing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3mnZ0JehmgDBzG0vHScCRH?si=d4b093cf5b9c4c17&quot; title=&quot;link to spotify&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;re Out Wasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; off of his 2015 &lt;em&gt;Bearer of Bad News&lt;/em&gt; that did it for me. It’s hard to pin down why art moves you, but my guess here is the Elliott Smith vibe, the unique three-string chords, the muted drums, the layers of harmonies, and the sticky chorus. &lt;em&gt; / While you&amp;#x27;re out wasting time with the right guy. / &lt;/em&gt;Now, I know jack about poetry, but as a designer, I appreciate the hell out of efficiency. That chorus tells the whole story. I ran to my guitar to figure out the main riff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;The first line at the concert was a thinker.&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;God mulls: &lt;em&gt;/ What happens when they die? Maybe eternal life? /&lt;/em&gt; Track one, side one of his newest record &lt;em&gt;Norm&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;p&gt;Norm is a rock opera, so it made sense to perform it chronologically. He did so and I enjoyed his sandwich strategy: playing side A fully, mixing it up with some favorites, and then closing out with side B, with an encore, fancy toothpick of &lt;em&gt;The Magician&lt;/em&gt; on top.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me was how the guitar faded into the background. For being “multi-instrumentalist” singer-songwriter, many of his songs still lead with the guitar on the recordings. This show nudged it to the back for 90% of the time — often using it to fulfill its original purpose as a rhythm instrument. He chose humility, putting the song in the spotlight instead of himself. Similar to his choice to put leafy greens between him and the spotlight on stage. An earthy take on a front-man wearing sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;figure&gt;
			&lt;picture class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
				&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/andy-shauf-plays-norm/img/andy-shauf-and%20flute-higher-ground-burlington-2023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andy Shauf with the his two horn players&quot;&gt;
			&lt;/picture&gt;
				&lt;figcaption&gt;Andy, his flutist, foliage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		&lt;/figure&gt;

		&lt;h3&gt;His music swells. &lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;He knows how to use a rest and how to work with silence. During the quieter moments, the crowd got to murmuring, which annoys a super-fan but I also understood. At times the band resembled ambient background lounge music, or veered towards a cocktail jazz band playing to small tables. Maybe murms are just part of being a quieter, understated band. As he gained more control over the crowd, the murmurs were silent. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;He let his personality shine some during the three banter-breaks, where he asks the audience if they have any questions. His awkwardness is very relatable, as told by the crowd cracking up to this question. He leans into it. He writes about it in his reoccurring themes of unrequited love and dabbles of self-hatred. He skips questions about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxwarren.bandcamp.com/album/foxwarren&quot;&gt;Foxwarren&lt;/a&gt; reboot and answers what he’s had for dinner. It was chicken. And it was good. He takes a deeper one delving into the story behind Norm’s name. Then, we learn he has no pets. We’re getting to know Andy. This is the beginning of a friendship. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;When the music swells loudly, he has the crowd in the palm of his hand. All six players jam at once at the climax and the crowd eats it up. Twin clarinets, synth, bass, the expressive, one non-stoic band-mate drummer all crash together. It’s rare to hear distortion in his music, but during the show he breaks out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://equipboard.com/pros/andy-shauf?gear=guitars#214528&quot;&gt;Silvertone&lt;/a&gt; to treat us to its gritty sound during these electrifying swells. He’s at his most rock ‘n’ roll. Repeating his stanky riff on the low strings as we buoy and ask for more.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Midlake comes to mind as they also feature a multi-flute setup and even had foliage on stage during a Boston show I attended in 2010. Maybe the flutes demand greenery. One can’t see stage plants and not think of Kurt’s lilies on Nirvana unplugged, especially with Shauf’s shoulder-length locks. As a whole, Shauf’s tunes are more upbeat and bright than Midlake’s deep forest jams. I appreciate them both weaving in winds to rock. On the album &lt;em&gt;Neon Skyline &lt;/em&gt; he traded some clarinet for guitar, but live, the instruments’ weights were reversed. These versions felt more &lt;em&gt;Andy&lt;/em&gt;, if that’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;When I caught him on his &lt;em&gt;Magician&lt;/em&gt; tour in Montreal back in 2016, I was once again captivated by the drummer’s performance. Even thought it was s different one. In his songs, the drums are typically hushed, sparse, and jazzy, especially so live. They’re not just for rhythm. They bring they’re own distinctive voice to the musical conversation. Both of the drummers during those sets were infectious to watch as they look like they’re having the best time. Also, both were placed at the front of the stage, off to one side, rather than in the typical center-back position.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Watching those passionate drummers made me wonder if something gets lost when one produces their own record, playing every instrument and writing each part. Which is his usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://andyshauf.com/music&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;. Despite my admiration for &lt;em&gt;Norm’s&lt;/em&gt; brilliance, with its 70’s disco flair and tasty synths that lock music and themes to characters, as well as it’s damn unique thought-experiment of...&lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;what if God didn’t understand love?&lt;/em&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but wonder what it would look like with more than one mind in the crucible of creation. What if we threw a Paul into the mix? This curiosity was further piqued when the drummer captured us all with a solo. How many drum solos have you heard this year? This one was good. He had me on the edge, trying to anticipate where he would take us next. Each new moment was an eye-squinting, head-bobbing surprise. What if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; helped write some tunes?&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Andy is a storyteller who happens to do music. He even hired a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stereogum.com/2211285/andy-shauf-norm-track-by-track/interviews/footnotes-interview/&quot;&gt;story editor&lt;/a&gt; to help him tighten up the story into yummy songs. It was no surprise when he said in a podcast that a book or series of short stories might be on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr&gt;


		&lt;p&gt;I’ve never considered myself writer. Just a designer. That’s a reflection of my psyche and warped expectations about what it means to be a writer and how if you can’t write fast, you’re no good. Also it touches on something deeper of not thinking I have anything to say. But, here we are. Maybe this blog is my public questioning of these beliefs. I’ve photographed music but never written about it. It’s odd because music has been a consistant character in my life. It’s just never worked its way into words. It’s a connection I’ve maintained since teenage years, when many of us seek out its partnership. While that connection may drop off for others, I’ve held onto it tightly, refusing to be stuck in a playlist from my formative years.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Here’s to writing what you know.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Wobblies’ &lt;span&gt;timeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired and sourced from the graphic novel: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384897.Wobblies_A_Graphic_History_of_the_Industrial_Workers_of_the_World&quot;&gt;Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt;, which features a different comic artist for each subject/era, and also by &lt;a href=&quot;https://colly.com&quot;&gt;colly.com&lt;/a&gt;’s timeline, I made this page to tell the story of the famous labor union’s prominent figures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What struck me was each artist’s unique tribute to the legendary fighters. To not let them drip from my mind sieve, I snapped photos as a way to help remember their stories, before returning the book to library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;At one time they had 100k members in the US and 10k+ worldwide. They aim to unite all workers, regardless of skill level or trade, into one big union to overthrow capitalism and establish a more just society.&lt;/p&gt;

Parsons is a powerful speaker and fights for the rights of workers, women, and people of color. She’s a key figure in the Haymarket Riot of 1886 which is a bloody affair resulting in dead police and executed activists. However, it helps spark a movement for better working conditions, the eight-hour workday, as well establishing of May 1st as International Workers’ Day. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/wobblies/#fn1&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;footnote-label&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The strike lasts six long months, involves 24k workers, and results in a shorter workweek, increased pay, and better working conditions.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/wobblies/#fn5&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;footnote-label&quot; id=&quot;ref5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In 1915, she starts a lecture tour in which she advocats for women’s access to birth control, a topic that was taboo at the time. She remains an influential figure in the birth control movement until her death in 1940. She was arrested several times for participation in strikes, and eventually deported from the US for her beliefs. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/wobblies/#fn7&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;footnote-label&quot; id=&quot;ref7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Little’s dedication to labor rights and his commitment to nonviolent protest makes him a target for the authorities.

      <title>Freelancing in the Gift</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/gift/</link>
      <description>


&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;I make websites &amp; logos &lt;span&gt;in the Gift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gift economy is a method of exchange based on trust. I do projects from time to time using it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I provide my services to you as a gift, and I trust you to gift back what (if anything) you feel is appropriate. That’s it. No formal contracts. And I’m happy to give a ballpark or range as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If that excites or at least interests you, good! We’ll still have timelines, deliverables, and super-fun strategy sessions. The websites and logos aren’t free and value-less. They have value. What precisely that value is&amp;mdash;is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have had the privilege of working on six projects so far under the gift economy. We&#39;ve exchanged branding and websites for everything from cash to handmade beds, carved signs, beer, and bread.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;The agreement:&lt;/h2&gt;     
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From my end,&lt;/em&gt; I promise to deliver your project to the best of my ability, within scope, and on time. I&amp;#8217;m honored by your trust and I&amp;#8217;ll strive to leverage my experience to help you succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From your end,&lt;/em&gt; you trust I’ll keep my side of the agreement and offer what feels right; some upfront, some in the middle, some at the end. This extra layer of trust makes this model stand out from the default economy of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each time I begin a new project in this model, the client and I enter in a little nervous and curious. But, once out the other side, with the new design solution completed, we feel refreshed that we engaged in a new way of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;But, why?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I do what I do for the same reason I tend to my garden, plant saplings, and turn sap into syrup. Realistically and practically speaking, it may not make sense: my family consumes only a small fraction of the food I grow each year, and the amount of maple syrup I make barely dents our monthly grocery bills. But it&#39;s not about practicality.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For me, it&#39;s an experiment, a way to explore my boundaries in a safe space. On one hand, it feels childish: drawing an imaginary line around a part of the yard, naming it a &quot;fort,&quot; and rewriting the rules. But it&#39;s also liberating to opt out of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Join me in taking a step towards the new world we want to live in - one where every transaction carries more personal weight.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://wescarr.com/img/branding@2x.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 800px)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/img/branding-sm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ten logos I’ve created for small businesses, 4 of which were done in the gift&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My experience&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I was moved and inspired by a local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brushbrookcommunityfarm.org/&quot;&gt;bakery/farm&lt;/a&gt; trying it. They pulled their scrumptious sourdough bread off the shelves and decided to give away hundreds of loaves every weekend. They make enough money to meet their needs through donations and, more importantly, are making waves.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href=&quot;http://sacred-economics.com/about-the-book/&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433775.The_Gift&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/04/adrian-hoppel-gift-economy_n_4702459.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;, and the live example above drew me in to give it a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not the first one to dabble with the pay-what-you-want (PWYW) model. Working from a broad definition see: a Panera Bread trial store, a Radiohead album, Potlatch, donating blood, Free libraries, seed libraries, mutual aid, open source software, &lt;a href=&quot;https://buynothingproject.org/about/&quot;&gt;The Buy Nothing Project&lt;/a&gt;, couchsurfing, the 26-location volunteer-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karmakitchen.org/&quot;&gt;Karma Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, a coffee at Vermont rest stops, and open source software. To name a few examples of giving freely without an expectation of reciprocity. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s truly a fresh take on exchanging service for value. Traveling down a brand new avenue creates a bond deeper than a standard transaction that&amp;#8217;s over as soon as the money is paid.&lt;/p&gt;
       
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wes and I worked on multiple projects in the gift. It was handy for me to pay what I could to get the project rolling and what I could along the way. His design and strategy insights have made my life easier and business more profitable.”
            &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecarvedsigns.com/&quot;&gt;Keith Schoenberger, Fine Cabinetry Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;I’m no pro&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve only offered this model with local folks I can meet face-to-face or folks I already know. Radiohead said their PWYW trial did so well only because of their already loyal fans. Without any emotional or personal attachment to the business or musician, people are more likely to take advantage of the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I believe there is a way to open it up beyond existing relationships, however, but I haven’t tried it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Lunch break sacred places</title>
      <link>https://wescarr.com/blog/lunch-break-sacred-places/</link>
      <description>&lt;section class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt;
	&lt;time class=&quot;meta-date&quot; datetime=&quot;Jan 31, 2019&quot;&gt;Written: Jan 31, 2019 | Updated: Nov 2, 2024&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Lunch break sacred places&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each of my computer jobs, I wound up finding a nearby place that became a home base of sorts, on lunch breaks - my break from people and screens. This happened viscerally and unintentionally. Apparently, my mind and body required it and I abided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Typically I consider myself terrible at maintaining new habits.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one stuck because the need was deep. Repetition in a routine like this deepens your awareness of a place. The place becomes a character in the story and a relationship between the two of you begins. You pick up new observations with each visit and a mental replica gets constructed in the psyche, with a layer of detail added on each visit. This layering isn’t linear; instead, complexity deepens in unpredictable ways, like humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was thinking about writing this post, previous sacred places from my past bubbled up as landmarks in my timeline. Countless tree forts, the weird attic that had a tiny door off my bedroom… most of them were outside. Maybe that’s because indoors was too populated, too busy, too disconnected. I had a drive to create little worlds that were better with a few buds, some were better in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a snapshot of places like this in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brady People ID, Burlington, MA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have photos from this era because this was before phones had a decent camera and my lunch spots weren’t photogenic anyway. They took place either in the office or browsing Newbury Comics and Barns &amp;amp; Noble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meandering the aisles was darn fulfilling and I’d always exit with my mental batteries topped off. I’d take an hour to flip through the new heavy-paged Rosenfeld Media book on ux or css. This era was also the dawn of podcasting. I’d often listen to shows like radiolab while scarfing down wendy’s dollar menu items. Though more commercial and not sacred, these were my retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brady People ID, Billerica, MA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office moved and more of my breaks were spent outside exploring. This north-central region of Massachusetts was new to me. I don’t remember having one specific spot, but I got that hip new Instagram app and an even hipper panorama app which inspired capturing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web design studio was tucked into a strip mall and had a store front. Looking back, I understand how I came to adopt regular retreats to fresh air, plants, and dirt. While the endless pavement became too much, I did frequent some of the shops, like Boloco for their decent burritos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bike path on an old rail bed nearby that was just beautiful. It was often packed with like-minded pavement cynics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;iMarket, Winooski, VT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined the company, I brought with me my recharging ritual. The location was phenomenal for it. The office sat near the mouth of the Winooski river, downstream from the dam. I had a spot I would go that allowed me to explore and linger a few moments during lunch. The spot was no secret. There was evidence of drinkers and other lingerers, and further back still, ruins of woolen mills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One winter day, my spot gave strong medicine in the form of a frozen coyote carcass. At the time, I was reading the work of Naturalist Tom Brown Jr. He uses the term medicine that follows Native American traditions, referring to a spiritual force rather than its conventional association with physical healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Medicine means the presence and power embodied in or demonstrated by a person, a place, an event, an object, or a natural phenomenon.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial awe, of brushing off the snow to the sight and presence, can still be conjured. I couldn’t get enough. Being with it felt magical and sacred. As winter passed into spring, one day the body was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;iMarket, Colchester, Vermont&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company moved to the third floor of a business park. You wouldn’t think there would be much break from the pavement, but remember, this was Vermont. There was a loop in an adjacent business park other walkers would take. When the air and light were right, we’d be out there circling. There was also a path through a 200-yard corridor of woods that led to the back of a Shaws. This was air conditioning in the summer, a canvas for animal tracks in the winter, and a decent spot to watch birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps iNaturalist and Merlin Bird ID also did their part to pull me outside and prompt me to observe and identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Designing at a niche-agency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republishing an old post about working as a ux designer at a small burlington agency. At the time of this writing, my role I had been a ux designer for 3 years after having spent 1 year before as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In a nutshell...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped literally hundreds of contractors succeed by providing custom site designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my contributions. The 4 big ones were Custom UI Design / Art Direction, Product Improvements, Documentation, and Conversion Rate Optimization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offered marketing and strategy to small to midsize 
contractors. They have over 300 clients and earned the Inc 5000 the last
 4 years. It’s made up of 42 people between offices in Vermont and 
California, and remote workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve matured much since I joined at their 4 year mark. Silos of design, development, and content have eroded reducing the &lt;em&gt;lorem ipsum&lt;/em&gt;
 I put out into the world. They’ve become discerning when choosing 
clients, have shortened site-build time tremendously, and even have 
plans to hire an HR role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom UI Design / Art Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constraints stimulate innovation. No, really.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary charge was to design sites that provided leads. Making that phone ring. Making those forms complete. It was essentially the same site over and over again. That 
constraint supported my growth as a designer as it encouraged 
resourcefulness and inventiveness. Other constraints were annoying at 
first but ended up giving that little push toward innovation, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only using Google Fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rigid content requirements for SEO strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality of client photography (we did all we could to avoid stock photos)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality of client branding (we didn’t do identity. I did touch up logos under the radar. I was thrilled when we&#39;d get a client who had professional branding, like from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickcharge.com/portfolio/?_sft_category=logo-branding&quot;&gt;kickcharge&lt;/a&gt;. I knew they&#39;d already invested in branding and, thus, knew its value and the assets would be in the right format and thorough.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deadlines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each design was on a tight, 3-day deadline. As the team matured, we were able to tune in the processes and decrease that turnaround time. With the client expectations and branding assets in hand, I went to Photoshop (later, xd) to create a homepage and subpage design. I wore an art direction hat to evoke the right emotion for our client’s audience and a UI hat to execute that connection using visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the content structure and sitemap were the same every time, the design was unique, so developers had to code the nuances for each one. The more I knew what the developers were capable of, the less back-and-forth we had. That knowledge also aided when meeting with customers about their wild, un-codable ideas. I’d help nip it early and guide them toward something doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patterns?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save time and join the rest of the industry, the devs and designers joined forces to create a pattern 
library. The plan was to patternize every piece of the site. To accommodate the differences, the system would need to be flexible and need many variations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built the structure and were giddy about the calculated time we’d save. But, the team quickly realized that fine-tuning a single pattern was labor-intensive and ate into time for client work. This surprise stifled the energy and put it on pause until more people were hired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of harnessing &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that energy, the design 
team chose certain patterns to reuse internally. We reeled in our creativity. We built fewer new things, referencing to devs what had already been launched. It saved time and was a decent half measure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example blocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show my various solutions to the same content, here’s an exhaustive list of &lt;em&gt;Services Carousel &lt;/em&gt;examples. To dig further into one client, check out this nautical-themed &lt;a href=&quot;https://wescarr.com/work/project/nautical-hvac/&quot;&gt;delight&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-improvements&quot;&gt;Product Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger breakthroughs took place outside of client deadlines. Often, 
innovation begins with questioning the norm — this is my bread and butter. My improvement highlights include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejuvenating legacy pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a high-converting mini-form to all pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing grids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrading a mockup display tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building live prototypes design proposals (ex, form updates to include float labels and expandable fields)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started, the designs were not yet part of the responsive 
bandwagon. Now, because of incremental updates, I can honestly say 
our sites have a stronger design and are faster than most competitors. Here’s 
the collective process each update follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brainstorm with Design Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create proposal for stakeholders (Customer Experience, Development, Programming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate with everyone involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver proposal and test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/ims/img/before-after-1.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A loyal client’s initial 2013 design and recent 2018 upgrade. Notice the decrease in clutter and the increase in white-space.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the first designer in our department. As we grew to 3, it 
became crucial to share what was in my head with the team. This helped 
not only with onboarding new designers, but also in bringing design into the 
open and giving it a seat at the big table. I wound up really enjoying the governance part of the role and saw it as democratizing knowledge. Sharing the wealth of knowledge hoarders with the masses, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created key document that unified our messaging in-house and when talking to clients, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversion Optimization Principles&lt;/em&gt;: 9 high-level design principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glossary&lt;/em&gt;: the name and use of every website piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Portfolio&lt;/em&gt;: website of selected designs and words to use when talking to prospective clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Client Media Guide&lt;/em&gt;: tips on capturing and delivering high-quality images and videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Documentation&lt;/em&gt;: the departmental wiki&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/ims/img/documentation.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Snippets from 3 company-wide docs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cro&quot;&gt;Conversion Rate Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lead a project introducing Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) to 
the company. The outcome was a protocol for researching analytics 
and heatmaps to find opportunities for CRO. After following the process, you end up with a 
hypothesis for a high-ROI design change. Then, you present it to the 
client, put in place, and test the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the union of data-informed and gut-informed design. I’m proud
 of this project because its potential was evident. It resulted in the 
formation of a CRO team and a plan for a stand-alone CRO product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://wescarr.com/blog/ims/img/cro.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The stuff of teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the disclaimer that every accomplishment with my name on it should have a giant &lt;em&gt;asterisk&lt;/em&gt;
 thanking others. Looking at you 
Development, Programming, SEO, CX, SEM, Content, Email Marketing, and 
Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launches (from 2018) and legacies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of the web, legacies don’t last long. It’s rewarding to see sites you built still live years later—it means they’re doing their job. Losing a client to another agency was always a letdown, but they often carried over my design decisions (which they had every right to do). The work was portable: style guides, textures, backgrounds, flourishes, the overall vibe. Cheesy as it sounds, it felt good knowing the work would live on in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
