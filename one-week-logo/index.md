## It‚Äôs not for everyone

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. 

The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it's not for all of us.

<i>Logo in-a-week</i> reinvents the logo creation process by optimizing for speed while keeping the quality as high as humanly possible. 

The constraint prevents sprawl, prevents scope creep, and laser-focuses the decision-making process.

Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone‚Äôs input can be arduous. It's all in the name of doing it right, for this mark will represent your organization for hopefully decades.

## It is for...

those who want a handmade logo‚Äî<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. üëãüèª I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

It‚Äôs also only for Vermonters at the moment. It‚Äôs where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...


## Cost

This service follows the gift-economy model.

Meaning I‚Äôm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.

I think this is important right now. Assigning a dollar amount to every thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships. This is a pro-relationship business.

I‚Äôve used this model for many projects and I‚Äôm excited to expand it

## FAQ

### Why not 2 weeks?

I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.

It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.

And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.

And make sure it can be good for creative things.


### Why you?

<strong>Experience.</strong> Dozens of folks have trusted me to create their branding and half a dozen have taken a jump into the gift-world with me. 

<strong>Passion.</strong> Behind this idea is an urge to help small local orgs succeed. 

When you see that old pizza shop on Main Street getting cornered by Chili's and Texas Roadhouse -- the pizza shop's food may be delish, but their logo and branding are nothing enticing compared to those big shots.

I aim to help you expand your reach by creating a crunchy promise you can sink your teeth into, creating something recognizable, memorable, professional.

## Reminder: logos are magic

They have the power to communicate your values, philosophy, reputation, and what customers can expect by using succinct imagery.

Branding is the whole thing - the combination of messaging and visuals you consistently use.

Your logo is the core of your brand. 

With this service, it‚Äôs up to <i>you</i> to apply and express the logo in ways that resonate with your audience. 

It's also your responsibility as an org to back it up with action. 

The logo is the promise that you will.
