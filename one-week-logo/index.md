  ## This service might be for you, if...
  
  <ul class="checks">
    <li>You live in Vermont.</li>
    <li>You’re open to working in the gift economy.</li>
    <li>You’re ready, or can be soon, to get a new logo.</li>
  </ul>

  
  ### No, it’s not for everyone.
  
  The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it’s not for all of us.
  
  <i>Logo in-a-week</i> argues that constraint prevents sprawl and scope-creep. And laser focuses the decision making process.
  
  Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone’s input can be arduous. 
  
  Get it done quick so you can take a breather.
  
  
  ## Cost
  
  This service follows the gift economy model.
  
  Meaning, I’m prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or in some other way.
  
  I think this completely radical idea is important right now. Commerce-as-usual is the air we breathe. It reinforces the idea that every task should be monetized and counted. This tends to minimize relationships and cease them at moment of transaction.
  
  This service is an experiment toward pro-relationship business.
  
  I’ve used this model for many projects and I’m excited to expand it.
  
  I wrote more about <a href="/blog/gift/">freelancing in the gift here</a>.
  
  
  ## Proof that good branding pays
  
  I had the pleasure of working with this branding companies logos before.

  They track the impact of their logos in terms of client revenue.

 ## Here’s how it works

      <summary> Why not 2 weeks? </summary>
      <div>
        I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.
      
        It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.
      
        And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.

      <div>
        In the last 10 years, i helped 342 orgs create a positive, memorable impression. Half a dozen have taken a jump into the gift-world with me. 
      
        Behind this idea is an urge to help small local orgs succeed. 
      
        I want to give that old pizza shop getting cornered by Chili’s and Texas Roadhouse a fighting chance.
      
        I aim to help you expand your reach by creating a crunchy promise your potential customers can sink your teeth into.

        Lastly, taste. This is a real reason why people hire designers. I know what good design looks like and can help channel your vision into something pleasing.

        Very astute question, reader.
