## This service might be for you, if...

1. You live in Vermont.
2. You’re open to working in the Gift economy.
3. You’re ready, or can be soon, to get a new logo.

<!-- those who want a handmade logo—<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. 👋🏻 I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

It’s also only for Vermonters at the moment. It’s where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a  that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...

### No, it’s not for everyone.


The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it’s not for all of us.

<i>Logo in-a-week</i> argues that constraint prevents sprawl and scope-creep. And laser focuses the decision making process.

Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone’s input can be arduous. 

Get it done quick so you can take a breather.


## Cost

This service follows the gift-economy model.

Meaning, I’m prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or in some other way.

I think this completely radical idea is important right now. Commerce-as-usual is the air we breathe. It reinforces the idea that every task should be monetized and counted. This tends to minimize relationships. 

This service is an experiment toward pro-relationship business.

I’ve used this model for many projects and I’m excited to expand it.
