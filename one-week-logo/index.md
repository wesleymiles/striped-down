## It‚Äôs not for everyone


The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it‚Äôs not for all of us.

<i>Logo in-a-week</i> argues that constraint prevents sprawl and scope-creep and laser-focuses the decision-making process.

Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone‚Äôs input can be arduous. 

Take a breather and get it done quick.


## It <em>IS</em> for...

those who want a handmade logo‚Äî<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. üëãüèª I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

It‚Äôs also only for Vermonters at the moment. It‚Äôs where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...


## Cost

This service follows the gift-economy model.

Meaning I‚Äôm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.

I think this is important right now. Assigning a dollar amount to every thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships. This is a pro-relationship business.

I‚Äôve used this model for many projects and I‚Äôm excited to expand it.
