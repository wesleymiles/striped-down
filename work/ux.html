			<h2>1. Pattern Library Cuts Days Off Build Time</h2>
			<!-- <h2>1. Early Voice &amp; Contributor to Pattern Library for Marketing Agency</h2> -->
			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>The company built sites mostly from scratch. Devs and designers used personal methods of reusing code and design for efficiency.</li>
			    <li>Designers delivered desktop mockups only, so devs were responsible for all breakdowns. Because many design decisions were made by non-designers, the mobile ux wasn't optimal.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>
			    	I was excited ðŸ¤© and drooly ðŸ¤¤ about <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com" target="blank" class="external">Atomic Design</a> and pitched wireframes and a vision to the tech team explaining how a design system would improve our reusing methods. <em>To be clear, each site had a mini design system itself comprised of reusable elements like colors, buttons, and styles. The agency design system model would to make building the mini systems easier. Similar to the WYSIWYG of Square Space.</em>

			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	It didn't catch on, but the spark surfaced a need to unify the names of every single site piece. A new committee and I created a company-wide glossary, so everyone knew what you meant when you said "Hero" and we banished the use of "Banner."
			    	<a href="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/pattern-library/glossary.png" alt="Anatomy of a website document screenshot" /></a>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    	A year later, the company was ready to implement. My team and I designed three responsive views for each piece of functionality, based on  existing sites.

			    </li>
			    <li>Since I understand front-end code, I acted as the conduit to development during build.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>Months later we had a working library of 60 patterns for dev and design to leverage reusing work.</li>
			    <li>We had a process for library maintenance (retiring and adding new patterns).</li>
			    <li>It improved dev efficiency from 10 to 5 days, and design from 4 to 3 days.</li>
			    <li>It improved our mobile UX because the patterns included breakdowns of 3 responsive views.</li>
			</ul>	
			<p class="lessons-learned"><em>Lesson learned: Ideas turn into realities much faster when you have top-down approval. Keep pitching until one gets prioritized.</em></p>

			<h2>2. Improved Outdated Landing Page Designs with Research</h2>

			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>Many of our 300 clients use landing pages to drive traffic from various marketing channels. They all used a single template which was outdated, not optimized for conversion, and clunky to launch.</li>
			    <li>The company green-lit improving this system with the goal of having pages designed and built with specific purposes in mind as well as leveraging existing data.</li>
			    <li>I sat on the research team converting findings into visuals.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Action:</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>Our research team listened to customer calls to determine common buyer personas.</li>
			    <li>Together, we created four personas and user-stories tying them to various types of landing pages.</li>
			    <li>
			    	<p>Based on our findings, I designed a low-fi wireframe that satisfied our personas and the dynamic features the system was receiving. I leaned on internal and industry best practices for landing pages.</p>
		        <p><em>For example, someone with a plumbing emergency needs to know the company can fix the problem fast, as opposed to someone considering a new heating system, who may want to learn a lot about the system and company installing it.</em></p>
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/low-fi.png" alt="Image of persona, their pain-points, who they are, why they're on this site - and a small wireframe" /></a>
		    	</li>
			    <li>
			    	In response to feedback from stakeholders, I designed higher fidelity wireframes.
		    		<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/hi-fi.png" alt="Image of 2 wireframes from a landing page about heating services. No images and little style, mostly grey boxes showing structure." /></a>
			  </li>
			    <li>Once approved, the design team and I retrofit existing clients to the new system and created processes to get new clients up and running.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Result:&nbsp;</h4>
			<ul>
			    <li>New landing page system launched.</li>
			    <ul>
			        <li>
			        	It populates with dynamic content from our dashboard and styles specified from designers.
		    				<a href="/img/ux/landing-pages/dynamic-sq.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/landing-pages/dynamic-sq.png" alt="2 screenshots from the elements and molecules section of the dynamic style guide." /></a>
		    			</li>
			        <li>Hundreds can be created at a time now.</li>
			        <li>
			        	Once the styles are added, future landing page designs will have a base to pull from. It's a version of a living style guide.

			        </li>
			    </ul>
			</ul>
			<p class="lessons-learned"><em>Lesson: This project was a challenge across the board because no one person owned it. So there was no authority to go for questions. It launched and was a success but was a serious learning experience for the company about PM.</em></p>

			<h2>3. Data-Team Creates An AB Testing Protocol & Gets A Couple Wins</h2>
			<h4>Situation:</h4>
			<p>As a new team, we had no systems of process yet, just the dream of data. On it sat an SEO specialist, a developer, a SEM specialist, and le designer (moi).</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Actions / Results</h4>
			
			    <p><strong>Processes!</strong> <em>I lead the following:</em></p>
			    <ul>
			        <li>Determined platforms for AB testing, usability testing, and heatmapping.</li>
			        <li>Created and implemented workflows.</li>
			        <li>Answered questions as they came in by running tests or analyzing data.</li>
			    </ul>
			
			    <p><strong>Proved a reduced word-count doesn't ruin SEO!</strong></p>
			     <ul>
			        <li>I helped run and strategize an AB test for existing content length vs shorter content length. Our hypothesis was that less words wouldn't hurt conversion.</li>
			        <li>Our page-views were low, so we bundled the test on 5 clients for more data.</li>
			        <li>The UX improved because no one likes reading an SEO-stuffed page and conversion improved.
				</ul>

			<p><strong>Retired a button strategy because of data!</strong></p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn&rsquo;t follow industry best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</li>
			    <ul>
			        <li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
			        <li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they&rsquo;re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. A no-no.</li>
			        <li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn't consider the user.</li>
			    </ul>
		    	<a href="/img/ux/testing/ab-quicklinks.jpg" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/testing/ab-quicklinks.jpg" alt="4 big buttons in above the fold, one flipped over showing 2 options" /></a>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Learned our hero buttons convert better when they go to a service page rather than a form page!</strong></p>
			    <ul>
						<li><em>The buttons had variations from just stating a service like "Air Conditioning", or the more conversational "I need Air Conditioning."</em></li>
			        <li>Using 3 research methods (heatmaps, click-tracking, and analytics research), I determined that:</li>
			        <ul>
			            <li>In general, the big buttons get a good amount of engagement so we shouldn't drop them all together.</li>
			            <li>We learned from click-tracking that we <em>should</em> stop sending people to forms because service pages converted better. <em>This may be because someone ends up on a form page too early in the process, before getting a chance to research if the company is a good fit. It's also not clear you're heading to a form. Again, we don't want surprises.</em></li>
			        </ul>

			    </ul>

			<p><strong>Moved field titles outside of the text-field box!</strong></p>
			    <ul>
			        <li>Putting the titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces a little clutter. We decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic. </li>
			        <li>As the viewer would begin to type their responses in the form fields, the prompt would disappear. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may be confusing for the user. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</li>
		    		<a href="/img/ux/testing/form-fields.png" target="blank"><img src="/img/ux/testing/form-fields.png" alt="4 big buttons in above the fold, one flipped over showing 2 options" /></a>

    		</ul>

			<p class="lessons-learned"><em>Lesson: AB tests need A LOT of data for statistical significance. We ended up canceling a number of experiments due to a lack of it. Our solution was to use aggregate client data and to be strategic when deciding to use AB testing.</em></p>
