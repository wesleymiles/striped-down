        <h1>Web design</h1>
        <p>Todays tech make it easier than ever do it yourself. But actually sitting in front of a screen and getting a site up and running is still a lot. Folks tend to appreciate having someone who knows the ropes. Decisions like what to work on next and what can wait until after launch aren't straight forward.</p>
        <p>See some examples of taking a brand and painting it on the medium of the web.</p>

<section class="--bg_ccs theme--dark">
    <img src="/img/ui/ccs-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="logo" />
    <p>Launched 10 years ago and still going strong. What started as a side project to a cabinet maker turned into a full time gig when the site helped produce steady work. </p>

        <h2>Sites for contractors</h2>
        <p>For 6 years, I’ve was part of a marketing agency dedicated to this industry. Below is a selection of sites I created for that agency.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="--charter">
    <img src="/img/ui/charter-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>Charter invested in branding before coming to us and it shows. Commitment to the direction of the brand is what makes this site successful. Our story was anchored in a nautical theme, and we used supporting metaphors and imagery.</p>

<section class="--bg_neyer theme--dark">
    <img src="/img/ui/neyer-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>This site is the result of a strong partnership with the client. Professional photographs wildly elevate the site’s impact. The color repetition, angle, and video in the hero are icing on the cake.</p>

<section class="--natals theme--dark">
    <img src="/img/ui/natals-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>One constraint we had was soley using google fonts. Here, I spice things up with a graphic of script not available from google. Mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the pattern library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

<section class="--bg_saddleback  theme--dark">
    <img src="/img/ui/saddleback-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>We don’t see many serif fonts in this industry so this was a bit of a novelty. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‘smart’ components, colors, and character styles. View the site to see animations like the truck sliding in.</p>

<section class="--bg_dc">
    <img src="/img/ui/dc-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>The client did the branding internally. I matched the trucks to the site by bringing in the curves from the logo. The site adhered to conversion principles in many places: a promotion is offered for filling out the Mini form, trust-icons high on the page, photos of actual happy customers, and custom photos throughout.</p>

<section class="--bg_thayer theme--dark">
    <img src="/img/ui/thayer-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>Great branding is not just a logo, but a toolbox of matching design elements. This client came to us with a full toolbox. In addition, they had a rich maintenance plan brochure which gave some direction in how to use the brand. Design themes include wavey-line separators, sunbursts, subtle textures, a mascot in color and monotone, a cursive font, and the retro mascot. I also designed a maintenance plan price graphic to help users understand the offering.</p>

<section class="--bg_altoff">
    <img src="/img/ui/altoff-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>This commercial client was treated differently than our more common residential owners. We limited content on the homepage and focused more on imagery.</p>

<section class="--bg_complete">
    <img src="/img/ui/complete-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>Their logo and headquarters itself already leaned toward a retro style. I pushed it further by introducing sunbursts, stripes, and angles. This aesthetic communicates longevity and nostalgia, which results in a sense of comfort and confidence in the business. </p>

<section class="--bg_gr">
    <img src="/img/ui/gr-site.jpg" width="800" height="713" alt="" />
    <p>One truck image was what was provided, and that was all I needed to build out this brand into something tactile and trustworthy. </p>
