		<h1>üé® User Interface Design </h1>
		<p>Like a PR makeover, I translate brands and messages across media in a way that reaches an intended audience.</p>
		<p>This page discusses the process then gives four examples.</p>

		<h3>UI for websites & beyond</h3>
		<p>For the last 6 years, I‚Äôve created responsive websites in the Home Services industry. The high-level to the low. Art direction to evoke the right emotion for the audience, and pixel-perfect details to execute that connection.</p>

		<p><em>But the umbrella of UI is wide</em> and in my experience includes:</p>
		<ul class="checks">
			<li>Dashboard design</li>
			<li>Internal marketing for social, ads, print</li>
			<li>Style guides</li>
			<li>Email marketing</li>
			<li>Really, any work that involves visuals</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>An obligatory peek behind the curtain</h2>
		<p>The process of a site design within our team of 3.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><h3>Discovery</h3></li>
			<p>Designers are provided a questionnaire from the client including a vision, a brand, assets, and specific goals. Then we hold a video call where we fill in any gaps needed to nail the design.</p>
			<p>My responsibility is to design a site that meets these goals:</p>
			<ol class="checks">
				<li>Align branding to feel 100% custom</li>
				<li>Optimize for lead conversion</li>
				<li>Wow the client by acheiving their goals</li>
				<li>Adhere to the design system and follow SEO guidelines</li>
			</ol>

			<li><h3>Research</h3></li>
			<p>Here, I learn about their competitors, their audience, and consider what general style we‚Äôll be using. I still use Dribbble during this stage, especially if there‚Äôs a challenging color to work with. In addition, I scour my 10 years of evernote snippets for relevant solutions.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/evernote.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Style guide</h3></li>
			<p>At this stage ,the messy double-diamond research comes to a point to make decisions and put findings in order. It‚Äôs not a linear process though, (nothing really is). I throw ideas into the style guide then take them for a spin on the artboard to see if they stick. The creation of the design happens along-side the actual design, together.</p>
			<p>The logo is central to a brand. I use it and any other marketing materials provided to flesh out the style guide with textures, shapes, and motifs.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/styleguide.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Design the thing</h3></li>
			<p><em>This is the intuitive, gut-stage and the hardest to write about.</em></p>
			<p>The header and footer are easy places to start. Early wins can snowball into momentum. While working at the header, I‚Äôll still get ideas for other sections so I‚Äôll do what I can to manifest the ideas. Whatever has the most promise, I follow. Sometimes this means focusing intensely on one thing until it clicks, while other times it involves hopping from section to section looking for a piece of promise.</p>
			<img src="/img/ui/design-snippet.jpg" />

			<li><h3>Critique</h3></li>
			<p>Critique is the key feedback loop that helps catch issues early and draws designers out of our heads. The CRO lead joins the design team to discuss whats working and whats not on the homepage.</p>
			<p>Then feedback is processed and it‚Äôs off to the client. üí´ü§ûüèª</p>

		<h2>Nautical-Themed HVAC</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/charter.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>My agency didn‚Äôt offer branding, so I have lots of experience making sub-par logos shine. Charter, on the other hand had a fresh rebrand, which helped me tell their story.</p>

		<h2>Retro HVAC Brand</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/natals.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>One constraint we had was only using google fonts. Here, I spice things up with a graphic of script not available from google. Mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the pattern library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

		<h2>A Plumber with Serifs</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/saddleback.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>We don‚Äôt see many serif fonts in this industry so this was a bit of a novelty. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‚Äòsmart‚Äô components, colors, and character styles. View the site to see animations like the truck sliding in.</p>

		<h2>Textures, Angles, and Gold Galore</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/gold-shield.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>A facelift for an HVAC company full of richness and character. Now, instead of only using the logo and yellow on marketing materials, they can use any and all textures and gradients from the website. Beyond the shine and gold, this site has other updates: WebP images, a truly mobile-first process (I provided full mobile mockups in addition to desktop to the devs), and if you look closely, a few SVG icons.</p>
