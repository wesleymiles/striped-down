			<h1>Web design</h1>
			<p>Like a PR makeover, I translate brands and messages across media in a way that speaks to an intended audience. Referred to also as User interface (UI) design.</p>
			<p>Below are three recent launches:</p>

		<p>For 6 years, I’ve was part of a marketing agency dedicated to one industry: Home Contractors. Below is a selection of website designs.</p>

		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="--charter">

		<h2>Nautical-Themed HVAC</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/charter.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>My agency didn’t offer branding, so I have lots of experience making sub-par logos shine. Charter, on the other hand had a fresh rebrand, which helped me tell their story.</p>

	<section class="--natals">

		<h2>Retro HVAC Brand</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/natals.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>One constraint we had was only using google fonts. Here, I spice things up with a graphic of script not available from google. Mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the pattern library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

	<section class="--blue">

		<h2>A Plumber with Serifs</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/saddleback.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>We don’t see many serif fonts in this industry so this was a bit of a novelty. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‘smart’ components, colors, and character styles. View the site to see animations like the truck sliding in.</p>

	<section class="--black">

		<h2>Textures, Angles, and Gold Galore</h2>
		<img src="/img/ui/gold-shield.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>A facelift for an HVAC company full of richness and character. Now, instead of only using the logo and yellow on marketing materials, they can use any and all textures and gradients from the website. Beyond the shine and gold, this site has other updates: WebP images, a truly mobile-first process (I provided full mobile mockups in addition to desktop to the devs), and if you look closely, a few SVG icons.</p>
