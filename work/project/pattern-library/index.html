					<li>The agency started with templated designs a decade ago.</li>

					<li><strong>More work for both dev and design.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Lack of standardization.</strong></li>

				<h2>Process</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>I strongly championed and pitched the idea of creating a design system after embracing Brad Frost’s Atomic Design. </li>
					<li>Initial energy uncovered a new need: that we all speak the same language. For example, we banned the term banner.</li>
					<li>I joined a team to spend 2 months creating a 23 page design glossary naming and defining of every site piece. We audited the hundreds of instances of non-defined components, and standardized them.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><em>The company was ready to move forward with the pattern building part months later.</em></p>

					<li><strong>Defined goals:</strong> improve mobile design & improve efficiency</li>
					<li><strong>Decided on which patterns to bring forward from every existing site</strong>, based on:

						 <li>Best practices for Lead Generation</li>
						 <li>The performance of our industry-specific sites</li>

					<li><strong>Responsive wireframes:</strong> the design team and I took the chosen patterns and converted them to wireframes. Some were already optimized for conversion, where others needed adjustments. </li>
					<li><strong>Considered flexibility:</strong> This is the big question with design systems… where can we bend the rules? We landed on if the structure changes, it's a new pattern.</li>
					<li><strong>Repeated:</strong> 3 versions for the 35 main site sections. This meant designers had 3 options for every content block. </li>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<h3>A design system of repeatable patterns and reusable code.</h3>
		<br />
		<div class="cols">
			<div class="col">
				<p>Components like buttons, animations, and menus are customized for each project, but the macro layouts are accounted for in the library.</p>
				<p>It’s regularly maintained. New ones requested, old ones retired. </p>
				<p><strong>Why this solution works:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				 <li>Shares knowledge between teams better</li>
				 <li>Takes design-weight off dev</li>
				 <li>Sites are more conversion optimized</li>
				 <li>CRO insight built into process</li>
				</ul> 
			</div>
			<div class="col">
				<h4>What would I change?</h4>
				<p>This was a necessary stage in systematizing technology for this agency. It's young compared to more mature design systems, but it showed the efficiencies that they can bring.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We have room to make the patterns more general to offer more reuse. Now they are 100% tied to content.</li>
					<li>Another big time-saver would be making the patterns live with a WYSIWYG, like squarespace or hupspot.</li>
