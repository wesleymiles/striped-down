projectTitle: Pattern Library 
description: Early adopter, contributor, and custodian of a pattern library at a marketing agency. Yes, we standardized components, but we did it in a way that allowed designers to be expressive. Scrappy, but efficient, this system saved lots of time, but has room to improve.

				<h2>New data and styles were added, but navigating around pages was clunky.</h2>
				<p>Here's what we did:</p>
				<ol class="legend">
					<li><strong>Nav overhaul.</strong> We use 3 main sections: side menu, header, and content area. Then broke horizontal nav bars into a header and vertical menu. This follows a convention people are used to and separates the multiple stacked navigations. </li>
					<li><strong>Emphasized company.</strong> Because this upgrade was primarily for clients, we wanted to let them know it was THEIR dashboard by adding their logo and a big company name.</li>
					<li><strong>Breadcrumbs.</strong> To let client know how to get home and go back while digging into their data.</li>

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>The data was decided. What was needed was to arrange it. The two designers, Nick and I, each took a stab at a solution. We both started with research of conventions and scouring a video of someone using a competitor's dashboard. We pitched both ideas to each other and came out with a unified idea to pitch as a team.</p>
		<p>Customer service found the pitch much easier to use and understand and appreciated the navigation was secondary to the lead-data.</p>

		<h2>Outcome</h2>
		<p>Beyond the merit of being referred to as the “sexy new dashboard”, the ones who this was designed for were on board. The dashboard team took the designs and implemented them with few changes. 300 clients can now access their data easier.</p>
