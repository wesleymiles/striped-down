					<h4>Stopped using quicklink flippers</h4>
						<p>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn’t follow industry best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
							<li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they’re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. A no-no.</li>
							<li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn’t consider the user.</li>

						<h4>Removed Form Field Box Titles from field</h4>
						<p>Putting field titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces some clutter, but we decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic.</p>
						<p><em>Cons: As the viewer begins to type their responses in the form field, the prompt disappears. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may confuse someone. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</em></p>

				<h3>Determined browsers being used by audience</h3>
				<p>Looked at a year of data for our top traffic clients to determine what percentage of traffic was coming from various browsers.</p>
				<p><strong>Result: Stopped support for older browsers which freed up dev time</strong></p>
				<p>We determined to fully support browsers which contribute 1%+ of traffic to our top sites. Decided to support browsers that provide .05%-1% on an as requested basis. Stopped supporting browsers that provide less than .04% of traffic.</p>

				<h3>New data and styles were added, but navigating around pages was clunky.</h3>
				<p>Here's what we did:</p>
				<ol class="legend">
					<li><strong>Nav overhaul.</strong> We use 3 main sections: side menu, header, and content area. Then broke horizontal nav bars into a header and vertical menu. This follows a convention people are used to and separates the multiple stacked navigations. </li>
					<li><strong>Emphasized company.</strong> Because this upgrade was primarily for clients, we wanted to let them know it was THEIR dashboard by adding their logo and a big company name.</li>
					<li><strong>Breadcrumbs.</strong> To let client know how to get home and go back while digging into their data.</li>
