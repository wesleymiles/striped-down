					<h4>Stopped using quicklink flippers</h4>
						<p>Upon research, we learned a method of button flippers we used didn’t follow industry best practices. These multi-state elements turnover to display new info on their back. What was wrong with them?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They hide conversion opportunities.</li>
							<li>They require a mouse-hover on desktop, but on touchscreens, they lack an indication they’re flippable. So people get surprised; which makes them feel less in control. A no-no.</li>
							<li>Clients liked seeing the flipping animation more they considered what links went on the back. Some instances wound up with a dump of links which didn’t consider the user.</li>

						<h4>Removed Form Field Box Titles from field</h4>
						<p>Putting field titles where placeholder text should go does save vertical space and reduces some clutter, but we decided the cons outweigh the aesthetic.</p>
						<p><em>Cons: As the viewer begins to type their responses in the form field, the prompt disappears. When submitting the form, if there was an error the title would no longer be present which may confuse someone. This may deter the user from submitting the form.</em></p>

				<h3>Browser Support</h3>
				<p>Looked at a year of data for our top traffic clients to determine what percentage of traffic was coming from various browsers.</p>
				<h4>Result: Stopped support for older browsers which freed up dev time</h4>
				<p>We determined to fully support browsers which contribute 1%+ of traffic to our top sites. Decided to support browsers that provide .05%-1% on an as requested basis. Stopped supporting browsers that provide less than .04% of traffic.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Researched a years worth of data for 40 clients</li>
					<li>Categorized promotions top 11 promotions types</li>
					<li>Calculated the direct conversion rate based page views / phone calls made from that page.</li>

				<h3>"Do shorter pages convert less?”</h3>
				<p>I helped run and strategize an AB test for existing content length vs shorter content length. Our hypothesis was that less words wouldn’t hurt conversion.</p>
		    <p>Our page-views were low, so we bundled the test on 5 clients and aggregated the data.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Growth in conversions by 16.65% </li>
					<li>No negative effect on keyword visibility. (This was found after assessing the experiment 6 months after launch)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Impact:</h4>
		    <ul>
					<li>Reduced the load of what writers had to write by half! </li>
					<li>UX benefits: Allows users to get their answer faster. Quicker to digest. More to-the-point.</li>

				<h3>“What CTA button converts better, 'Contact Us' or 'Get in Touch'?</h3>
				<p>On our first AB test, we sought to follow takeaways from bigger brands and test button wording. Our sites have the button wording vary from about 10 different options. </p>
				<p>We ran the estimates through the statistical significance calculator telling us we would need a pretty big boost in conversions to make this test useful.</p>
		    <h4>Results:</h4>
		    <p>We didn’t get it. Optimize went to its timing limit of 3 months over 3,471 Sessions and found no leader. Although inconclusive as a whole, the opposite of our hypothesis was leading the way —  “Contact Us” did better than “Get in Touch.”</p>

				<h3>Measuring quicklink conversion rates</h3>
				<p>These big buttons send folks to a service page as opposed to a form. They seem like a good idea, but we wanted to find out if that was true. </p>

				<p>Our data set included 2,751 form leads from 10 sites. </p>
				<h4>Results:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Average conversion rate: 14.09% (not bad compared to industry-standards).</li>
					<li>This accounted for 20.78% of all form leads and 4.83% of all leads. It proved safe to keep using them as we were. </li>

				<h3>An aid to Conversion Analysis</h3>
				<p>We had an unhappy client who was convinced their site was under-performing.</p>
				<p>We had no data that suggested there is a serious problem with conversion, since organic Cost Per Lead was strong. We performed this analysis in light of the client’s concerns about the drop in leads.</p>
				<p>Overall, the analysis showed that their site was overdue for a redesign. It was outdated, too busy, and broke current internal best practice</p>
				<h4>To support these claims heatmaps proved:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Poor design choices. Users didn’t always know what is a link and what’s not</li>
					<li>Excessive items in the nav. One had very low engagement that could be de-emphasized. </li>
					<li>Little engagement on one of the two main CTA buttons. This supported a best practice of having only one.</li>
				</ul>

		    <h4>Results:</h4>
				<p>Heatmaps helped visualize why they were in need for a redesign. They ended up pulling the trigger on one. </p>
