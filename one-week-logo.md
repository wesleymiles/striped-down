## Benefits

<!-- To do this, we minimize meetings. We will have a kickoff call, but all remaining back-and-forths are through a task management tool. To make use of the short timeline, we offer as many revisions as we can fit in the week. -->
<!-- (nicely designed) -->
  <ul>
    <h4><li>unlimited revisions within the week </li></h4>
    <h4><li>no meetings -- async communication</li></h4>
    <h4><li>no arduous process -- keep it simple</li></h4>
    <h4><li>100% custom logo not made by a robot</li></h4>
  </ul>


## This only works if we follow a tight process

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Kickoff</strong>: We we align on your vision and needs at our one and only meeting.</li>
    <li><strong>Draft</strong>: I share 2-3 rough concepts with you. You pick one.</li>
    <li><strong>Refine</strong>: I go back to nip and tuck, button up, and dial in your new logo. A many revisions as we can fit into a week.
    <li><strong>Deliver</strong>: I email you the logo, colors, and fonts -- all you need for web and print.</li>
</ol>



## It‚Äôs not for everyone

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. 

The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it's not for all of us.

<i>Logo in-a-week</i> reinvents the logo creation process by optimizing for speed while keeping the quality as high as humanly possible. 

The constraint prevents sprawl, prevents scope creep, and laser-focuses the decision-making process.

Meetings, revisions, and corralling everyone‚Äôs input can be arduous. It's all in the name of doing it right, for this mark will represent your organization for hopefully decades.

## It‚Äôs for...

those who want a handmade logo‚Äî<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. üëãüèª I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

It‚Äôs also only for Vermonters at the moment. It‚Äôs where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...


## Cost

This service follows the gift-economy model.

Meaning I‚Äôm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.

I think this is important right now. Assigning a dollar amount to every thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships. This is a pro-relationship business.

I‚Äôve used this model for many projects and I‚Äôm excited to expand it to this one. 



## FAQ

### Why not 2 weeks?

I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.

It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.

And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.

And make sure it can be good for creative things.
