## Benefits

<!-- To do this, we minimize meetings. We will have a kickoff call, but all remaining back-and-forths are through a task management tool. To make use of the short timeline, we offer as many revisions as we can fit in the week. -->
<!-- (nicely designed) -->
  <ul>
    <h4><li>unlimited revisions within the week </li></h4>
    <h4><li>no meetings -- async communication</li></h4>
    <h4><li>no arduous process -- keep it simple</li></h4>
    <h4><li>100% custom logo not made by a robot</li></h4>
  </ul>


## This only works if we follow a tight process

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Kickoff</strong>: our and only meeting where we align on your vision and needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Draft</strong>: I share 2-3 rough concepts with you. You pick one.</li>
    <li><strong>Refine</strong>: I go back to nip and tuck, button up, and dial in your new logo. Here, we'll do up to 3 rounds.
    <li><strong>Deliver</strong>: I email you the logo, colors, and fonts you need for web and print.</li>
</ol>



## It‚Äôs not for everyone

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. 

The long drawn-out process of brand creation absolutely has a place and is here to stay, but it's not for all of us.

<i>Logo in-a-week</i> reinvents the branding process by optimizing for speed while keeping the quality as high as humanly possible. 

It prevents sprawl, prevents scope creep, and laser-focuses the decision-making process.

Meetings, revisions, corralling everyone‚Äôs input. This can be arduous because you want to do it right for this mark will represent your company or org maybe for decades.

## It‚Äôs for...

those who want a handmade logo‚Äî<em>fast.</em> Yes, handmade by an actual human. Moi. üëãüèª I promise not to subcontract an AI. 

And at the end of the week, your custom logo will be sent in all the formats you need.

It's also only for Vermonters at the moment. It's where I live and my method of starting small. 

You also have to be open to a completely radical idea that goes against every way of thinking of commerce and buying things and exchanging services for money...


## Cost

This service follows the gift-economy model.

Meaning I'm prepared to give you this as a gift and you are welcome at the end of it to pay me, in money or other, or some other way.

I think this is really important right now because assigning a dollar amount to every single thing in our lives slowly corrodes relationships.

I'm doing this as an experiment to see if I can meet some cool people, exchange a service.




## FAQ

### Why not 2 weeks?

I believe that working within constraints allows space for excellent work.

It forces you, the business owner, to make decisions and not waddle, waffle.

And it forces me, the designer, to also make decisions and crank out excellent designs.

And make sure it can be good for creative things.
