			<h2>I use design to help businesses thrive.</h2>
			<p>Getting a slick website is probably the most fun part of marketing, but it's only part of your strategy. Is your logo or brand getting stale? Could you use another creative mind in your inner circle? Ever want to run an AB test?</p>
			<p>I can help at 3 different stages: your logo, your website, and your strategy. <a href="services">Read more</a></p>

		<h2>In the gift?</h2>
		<p>Yep. I offer my services to others using a new look_____ . No contracts, no written formal agreements. This means you and I get on the same page black bla black bla</p>
		<p>Don’t worry. There are still timelines, deliverables, and super fun strategy sessions. </p>
	<!-- 			<p>By day, I'm a designer who gets paid normally. By night (some nights and some weekends), I do contract design work using a totally different model: the gift economy.</p> -->
			<p>I've experimented with it with 4 clients and it's been awesome, so this site kind of revolves around that.</p>
