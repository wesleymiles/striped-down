		<h1>Wait...</h1>
		<h2 class="beefy">What’s this about the gift economy?</h2>
		<h2>It’s a method of exchange based on trust. </h2>
		<p>I’m experimenting with a radical form of doing business. Join me. 
		<p><em>Here’s how it works:</em> I promise to deliver your project to the best of my ability, within scope, and within the timeline and you agree to offer what feels right from your end. </p>
		<p>No formal contracts. Just a consensual willingness to trust. We'll still have timelines, deliverables, and super-fun strategy sessions. </p>
		<p>I’ve been gifted cash, handmade beds, carved signs, beer, and bread. I feel honored to have tried this with some people who were open to trying something new. “Gift Exchange begins with willingness as a sign of consensual relations.” </p>
