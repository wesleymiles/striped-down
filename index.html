		<h1>Wait...</h1>
		<h3>What’s this about the Gift-Economy?</h3>
		<p>I’m experimenting with a radical form of doing business -- a method of exchange based on trust.</p>
		<p><em><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></em></p>
		<ol>
			<li>I promise to deliver your project to the best of my ability, within scope, and within the timeline.</li>
			<li>You agree to offer what feels right from your end. Some upfront, some in the middle, some at the end.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>No formal contracts. Just a consensual willingness to trust. Don’t worry - we'll still have timelines, deliverables, and super-fun strategy sessions.</p>
		<p>I’ve had the honor of working on four projects so far in the Gift. We’ve exchanged branding and websites for cash, handmade beds, carved signs, beer, and bread. I know. It feels weird. It takes guts to take a different path.</p>
		<p>Join me.</p>
