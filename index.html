		<h2>Specialties</h3>

		<h4>Branding & Identity 👀 </h4>
			<p>Poor branding draws the wrong kind of attention. Done well, it ties every visual part of a business together. My services include: style guides to support existing brands, brand refreshes, and <em>startin’ out&trade;</em>. Samples below.</p>

		<h4>User Interface Design 🎨 </h4>
			<p>Data-informed and creative, I’ve helped hundreds of brands come to life and ship to millions of eyeballs. My work has been called <em>“well imagined, thoughtfully constructed, and meticulously brand-aware.”</em>  See <a href="work/ui/">examples</a>.</p>

		<h4>Analyzing effectiveness 📈 </h4>
			<p>Have you checked all that low-hanging friut? If not, you’re probably leaving &#128176; on the table. As part of a CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) team, we improve conversion through research and analysis. Because having swanky new design is only the beginning. <a class="external" href="mailto:wescarr@fastmail.com">Email for case studies</a>.

		<h1>Working in the Gift</h1>
		<h3>A method of exchange based on trust. </h3>
		
		<p>There are no formal contracts. Just a consensual willingness to trust. Don’t worry&mdash;we’ll still have time lines, deliverables, and super-fun strategy sessions. The websites and logos aren’t free and value-less. They have value. What precisely that value is&mdash;is up to you.</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">The time is ripe for alternatives. I know. It feels weird. It’s my way of taking a step toward a world I want to live in. A world with more personal weight tied to every transaction.</span></p>
		<p>My day job is salaried and that offers stability to try working in the gift. A <a href="https://www.brushbrookcommunityfarm.org/" target="blank" class="external">bakery/farm</a> down the road went all in two years ago with no safety net. They pulled their sourdough bread off the shelves and now give it away every weekend. They make enough money to meet their needs and, more importantly, are making waves questioning norms and paving the way for a fresh take on commerce.</p>
		<p>I’ve had the honor of working on four projects so far in the Gift. We’ve exchanged branding and websites for cash, handmade beds, carved signs, beer, and bread. </p>
