Chris Cohen - Caller No.99


Woke up a year too late, just to sit around and way


The clock on the radio, is swirling down


Station above the tuning down


It’s the signal that never comes, that never comes



The announcer by the phone, there’s waiting on and on


For caller number 99


I’m wondering what is mine, nature


What is like my nature?


And I dream at night,


Never was the right time to answer
It’s in the smile, trick a color blind
To change up, what it is my nature
I’m wondering what is mine, nature
What is like my nature?
