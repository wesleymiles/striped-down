Andy Shauf - Twist Your Ankle

This is an alternative version. Andy Shauf plays with the guitar tuned 1 1/2 steps down and a capo on 1st fret. To play that version simply transpose the tab 5 steps up (starting chord: Am7). 


[Intro / Theme]
Gm7  Dm7/F#  D#maj7/G  Dm7/F#  
D#maj7/G  Dm7/F#  D/A  D/F#

[Verse 1]
Gm7         Dm7             D#maj7
Last night, dancing slow in turning light
     Dm7              D#maj7
With you caught in my eye
     Dm7               F7          F6 F7
Well twist your ankle, leave my side
Gm7            Dm7            D#maj7
Goodnight, I’m tossing in the towel again
   Dm7                 D#maj7
Go laugh with all your friends
   Dm7            F7           F6 F7
Oh I don’t really understand them

[Bridge]
A#           D#maj7    
Everybody’s laughing at me
D7
Just let me walk home

[Chorus] (x3)
D#maj7
Du-du-du duuh
D#maj7    Dm7
Du-du-du duuh

[Chorus - Instrumental]
D#maj7  Dm7

[Verse 2]
(N.C.)               D#maj7
Oh god, stumble over to the door
Dm7                D#maj7
Trashed and out of line
   Dm7               F7
Oh I don’t think the fault is all mine
Gm7         Dm7              D#maj7
Last night, dancing slow in turning light
  Dm7                    D#maj7
I watched you walk right by
     Dm7             F7
Well twist my ankle, stay by your side

[Bridge]
A#           D#maj7
Everybody’s laughing at me
D7
I can’t make a sound

Du-du-du duuh

Du-du-du duuh

I wish I’d just stayed home
