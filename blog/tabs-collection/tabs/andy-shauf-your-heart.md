E		F#m	
In the summertime wind, in the heart of my home,

		B		E
in the dark of the night, in the way that you might.

E		F#m	
When our lips were closed and our words were few

		B		E
Oh, my dear, the days were shorter too.


	D♭m	D	F#m
But I never got too far

D♭m	B	E
from hoping for your heart

E		F#m	
I was praying quietly for a love that is real

		B		E
in my heart that hopes for an evening that heals.

E		F#m	
But my prayers are words and my words are whispers

		B		E
and my whispering mind is just wishing for time.



Cause I never got too far


from hoping for your heart

E		F#m	
When my darker days are my alibi

		B		E
when my lonely heart like a telephone line

E		F#m	
calls your name again through the clouds and the smoke

		B		E
There will be whisper "will you be my own?"


Cause I never got too far


from hoping for your heart


No I never get too far


from hoping for your heart
