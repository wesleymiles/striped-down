Do You Still Love Me Like You Used To?
BEST COAST



G
I wake up to the morning sun,
                               Em    Em   X
When did my life stop being so fun?
G
Wish I could care about someone, the way I used to.
                   Em    Em     X
When will this be done?


G
I'm always crying on the phone,
                                 Em    Em   X
Because I know that I'll end up alone.
G
Lord please forgive me for my sins
                                    Em   Em   X
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end


G
Do you love me like you used to?
Em
Do you, do you, do you?


G
I have no reason to complain,
                                          Em    Em    X
My feelings change, they melt away in my brain.
G
I keep myself awake at night,
                                            Em   Em   X
Sleep with the lights on, always ready to fire


G
I'm always crying on the phone,
                                 Em      Em    X
Because I know that I'll end up alone.
G                            
Lord please forgive me for my sins
                                     Em    Em    X
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end


C                  Am
I'm always running down the street
C                 Am                   
I don't remember what it means to be me
C                  Am
I left all of that sh*t behind
C                 Am
But still I seem to lose my mind,
G                       Em
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
