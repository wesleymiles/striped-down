Christmas Twin Falls Idaho is her oldest memory

D            C#mi                D                     Dmi 
She was only two, the first time she felt blue

D           C#mi              Bmi                E             
Cafeteria Harrison Elementary, 


 D            C#mi     D              Dmi 
Beneath The parachute, saw her without shoes

D        C#mi             Bmi             E

7-UP I touched her thumb, she knew it was me

D                     C#mi   D                    Dmi
Although she couldn't see....Unless of course she peeked

D                 C#mi         Bmi         E
My Moms good she got be out of Twin Falls Idaho

D                C#mi D                 Dmi
Before I got too old, you know how that goes

D                     C#mi    Bmi               E
Thats where she still was the summer she turned 17

D   C#mi  D                Dmi
1983.....three weeks after me

D                C#mi             Bmi          E
Last I heard was she had twins or maybe it was three? 

D                   C#mi  D                Dmi
Although I've never seen, except for in my dreams
