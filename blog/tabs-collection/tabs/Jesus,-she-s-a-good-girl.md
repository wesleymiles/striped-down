Jesus, she's a good girl

4 fret capo

C	C#	Am  C  F  C  D  F


C#	C	
And so it seems,

C#	Am	C	F
I will see you once again

D
In my dreams.
It's sort of strange,
You only haunt me when i'm trying
To leave you behind.

Why you always make me a liar
When i'm trying to tell the truth.
Jesus, she's a good girl
I don't want to hurt her.

The whisperings
In the middle of the morn
Liquor rests

Upon your words
But still in my slow beating heart
I'm not ashamed.
Oh maybe i
In the rising morning light
Should be blamed.

Why you always call me a liar
When i'm trying to tell the truth.
Jesus, she's a good girl
I don't want to hurt her.
