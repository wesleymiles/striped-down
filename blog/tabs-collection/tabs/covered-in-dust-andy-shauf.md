G spin my tires  A start my fires  C                  Em I will wade on through.  castle red  I'll be dead  long before you.  Bm            C I will die a poor man  Bm         C covered in dust,  dreaming of you.   G tip toes  A plain clothes  C                Em I am a closed hand.  chipped brow  somehow,  I hope you understand.  Bm            C I will die a poor man  Bm         C covered in dust,  dreaming of you.
