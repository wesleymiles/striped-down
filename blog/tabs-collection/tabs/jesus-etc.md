Jesus, Etc.
Wilco

Intro: Dm C (play 4 times)

Dm             C
Jesus, don't cry
Dm           Bb
You can rely on me honey
F                    G                      C
You can come by anything you want
Dm      C
I'll be around
Dm          Bb
You were right about the stars
F       G                   C      Bb
Each one is a setting sun


F           C    Dm         C       Bb
Tall buildings shake, voices escape
                                G    F                    C
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords
F                                     C    Dm             C
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies
Bb                               G     F      C
Turning your orbit around

Don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can come by anytime you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake, voices escape
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies
Turning your orbit around

Dm      C
Voices whine
Dm                    Bb
Skyscrapers are scraping together
        F           C
Your vocie is smoking
F           C             Dm          C
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Bb                C      F          C
Turning your orbit around

Dm   C
Our   love
Dm    Bb
Our    love
F       G                 C
Our   love is all we have

Our love
Our love is all (we've got so honey)?
Every one is a burning sun

Tall buildings shake, voices escape
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies
Turning your orbit around

Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

(end)
