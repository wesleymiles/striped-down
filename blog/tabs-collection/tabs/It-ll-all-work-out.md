A                    D

A                   D
it'll all work out

my mother was the youngest child
no college education
wasn't ever her style but
she knew just how to make a quarterback smile

it' would all work out
it'll all work out


my father loved us right
stayed up at night trying to keep the checkbook tighter
than a ducks ass going down on waterslide
ohh i know he tried
became a victim of the mortgage spikes
collections calling every night since 1999
in ten more years you  think the interest rates decline

it' ll all work out
it'll all work out
it'll all work out


the say go to college get you knowledge straighten up
with inherit desperation and the way it sounded
like you bet on it and now its seems â€¦ we're down
thank you dad I love you and I'll  make you proud
I'm sorry I didn't take the road you laid down

it' ll all work out
it'll all work out
it' ll all work out

is that you're litter in the middle of the park
i must have been out of town for quite a little while
the stitches in youre arm must have healed by now
fuck that plummer if youre heat is still out
and don't be scared I know you can still throw down

it' ll all work out
it'll all work out
it' ll all work out


I don't feel a speck of hate
really now I'm trying to get my story straight
when you called me from your car
when you were on your way with friend from san francisco
that you told me was gay, guess he was a closet straight

get it all out now
