Band Of Horses - Infinite Arms chords
 Intro:  F   Em7 [ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/b/band-of-horses/226806.html ] Verses: F   Em7 F I had a dream I had a dream Em7 That I was your neighbor About to give birth F And then everything Was really hurt Em7 And I was so lonely I didn’t see Its like F Living in a movie Twisting the plot Em7 My friends and family                            F     Em7 The little things Ive got, Ive got F            G           Am    Bm  C       When my thoughts drift to you    Verse 2: I love the morning I like to listen To 4am birdies Begging to feed Now there’s something here before me A figure, I think Isn’t there a warning Or something to drink My god, my god              G           Am    Bm  C        When my thoughts drift to you  Verse 3: These mended bones The storms approach Ever so slowly Out on the sea Theres an animal below me Lack of control Others came before me Others to come, to come              G           Am    Bm  C        When my thoughts drift to you
