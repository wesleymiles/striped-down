G
She keeps it simple
                                              C
And I am thankful for her kind of lovin'
                      G
'Cause it's simple

G
No longer do we wonder if we're together
                   C
We're way past that
                             G
And I've already asked her
         D                                   C            G
So in January we're gettin' married

G
She's talkin' to me with her voice
                                     C
Down so low I barely hear her
G
But I know what she's sayin'
                   C                                   G
I understand because my heart and hers are the same
          D                                     C              G
And in January we're gettin' married

G
And I was sick with heartache
                             C                           G
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her
G
But we would both surrender
                        C                            G
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down
         Am                       C
Don't ever turn it down

G
I hope that I don't sound to insane when I say
              C                      G
There is darkness all around us
G                                                                 C
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me
         G                                 C                         G
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin'
D                                             C
And in January we're gettin' married

G                                                              C
No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in
G
She knows which birds are singin'
                                                C                             G
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin
D                                               C
And in January we're gettin' married
D                                    C               G
Come January let's get married
