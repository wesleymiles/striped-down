Golden Light Bucket

I saw a barred owl today. At the exact moment I remembered to look toward the top of the forest for birds, we saw each other, and he flew off to a safer tree. I slowly made my way to the new tree and starred for a minute or two, then let him be.

When I entered my favorite spot with the up-rooted tree, the sun blasted through the clouds and showered the forest and I with orange light. I also found a bucket.
