        <p>Perhaps she had never confronted the voice in her head because it had been easier to listen to it. It had been safer to sustain the belief that she was a bad person. At least then she was in control.‚Äù

    <blockquote>
        <p>It was like her body was an ocean, and these feelings would always come and go like the tides. The task was not to let herself be pulled away by one of the currents. The task was to accept that her insides would feel violent and tumultuous at times, and to be okay with that.‚Äù

        <p>My family and I care for a 800 square feet garden in San Francisco's Mission District. Planning started in 2015 and we finally planted in January 2017. The process involved tearing up concrete, pouring a new sidewalk, hauling in clean soil, and patiently waiting for the wet season to plant.

        <p>All conflict
        Between friends, lovers,

        Frees the world of conflict.

        <p>We were told that ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs on streaming now‚Äù. We thought we‚Äôd have access to 120 years of cinema history. Instead, we have access only to the content that can be readily and easily monetised, trapped in garish and unreliable platforms. There‚Äôs no guarantee your favourite movie will still be streaming next month. It feels as if the internet‚Äôs vast early possibility has shrunk.‚Äù

    I've been an admirer of the Arlington, MA design firm <a href="https://goinvo.com">GoInvo</a> since I lived nearby. They're a small team who's narrowed their focus on one industry: healthcare, and they're dedicated to open source design. Anywho, they've put together a decent list of <a href="https://running.goinvo.com/design">design resources</a> within their team wiki.
