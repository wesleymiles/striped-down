    Reynolds Woodcock's extreme need for control in Phantom Thread: 

    ‚ÄúI cannot begin my day with a confrontation, please. I'm delivering the dress today, and I can't take up space with confrontation. I simply don't have time for confrontations.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúThe tea is leaving, but the interruption is staying right here with me.‚Äù

I'm a few months into working on Red Hat Docs. I appreciated Hashicorp's internal practices made public.

Or as they put it, "A website dedicated to making our implicit practices explicit."

How to write for the way your coworkers actually read. Loved this <a href="https://async.twist.com/writing-at-work/">article</a>. Basically, "front-load the important stuff."

Watched glass onion movie:

Nice story of the disruptor-elite class and their shackles to their world that are only breakable when they personally witness the systems falling apart.

Most poignant part: when the black woman started breaking the glass sculptures, everyone was OK with it. some even cheered her on. most elite were fine with it. then the lower elite class started breaking them and had fun and the leader didn‚Äôt care. then the woman took it further and the lowers stopped, aghast. the breaking point was the mona lisa. not sure what it signified, but it was the last sacred thing to these people.

How to Disagree with Someone More Powerful than You:

- risk assess NOT saying something
- it‚Äôs a chess not a boxing match
- ask permission to disagree
- how to say it
    - stay calm
    - stay humble,
    - stay neutral, no adjectives
