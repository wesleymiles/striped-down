This was my second Lips show and the first one on my road to sobriety. Being further back from the stage than I'm used to and having less chemicals in my system did make me feel further away from the music itself. Maybe it was my mood. I wasn't fully on the level with Wayne and his antics.

They did 'Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots' in full and the second set featured many if not most of the tracks from 'The Soft Bulletin.' 

If you turned around you could watch the sun ging down over lake champlain. They provided the city with the soundtrack for the sunset that night.
