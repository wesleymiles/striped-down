I was on the fence of whether to go to this show or not because it would just be me and it's awkward standing by myself before the music starts. It <em>was</em> super awkward, although not as awkward as when I was younger. I must have grown a hair more comfortable in my own skin. But, damn I'm glad I went. As the band started those feelings completely evaporated.

I didn't realize I was such a fan until hearing their how engrained their songs are in me. The [Arts Riot](../../diiv/arts-riot-2016) show in 2016 sent me over the edge into fandom, touring for their second album 'Is the Is Are'. I don't know many of the words. They're submerged into the music among guitar effects and echos, like other shoegazers. The foggy words make the actual words less important. 

Like others in the genre, it was loud. I need to start wearing ear protection. So solid, so good.

The supporting act, [Hello Mary](https://www.hellomaryband.com), was an amazing three-piece in ironic camo. I tuned into this act, as they harmonized and appeared way to young to have such a decent sound and crowd control. They were a good combination for DIIV -- their buzzy bass primed us for the act to come.
