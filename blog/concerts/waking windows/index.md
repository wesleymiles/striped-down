Only went to this yearly festival once, during its twelve year run. To be fair, they started before I moved to Vermont. Looking back at their lineups, I honestly don't know how I missed noname in 2018.

Yacht, the headliner, which I got no photos from, had to stop their set early because of noise complaints. I was ashamed to be part of the town who would let that happen, cut it off right at the climax of a 3-day music show.

My god. 


I was a fan before, but this show put me on another level. 


They were a festival hightlight, no question. 

They were touring 'The Agent Intellect', pitchforks favorite, and it has some bangers. The choruses are almost poppy in their repetition, if not for the raw, gripping talk-yelled energy. The unassuming, normal guy vibe of Joe Casey doesn't match his energetic Detroit belts. But the band does. Watching them made me imagine how they write their songs: the music as one part and vocals as the other. The instrumentalists coming to collaboration with pitch-worthy riffs and Casey lays his lyrics on top. Sans Casey, they'd still be a solid instrumental trio.
