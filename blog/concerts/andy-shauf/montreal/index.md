Andy was touring 'The Magician' and I was obsessed. I focused in on the sparceness of the drums. The drummer was quiet, but entertaining to focus on. I thought about whitespace in design and Miles Davis's famous quote about how the emptiness of a song is also the song. 

I bought some vinyls and chatted with Chris Cohen while he was meandering around the merch table.

My first child was in her mom's womb and less than a month from being born at this show.
