His older sister started preschool, but my wife and I were still off work, so us and my parents took to the mountain.

This summit is famous for its two Golden Retrievers, Sampson and Baylor, who were known to hike the trail alone, acting as unofficial guides for hikers. [PBS even hosts](https://www.pbs.org/video/mountain-dogs-8dyzc3/) a 15 minute doc about them. 

Baylor passed away in November 2020 at the age of 12, a year after this photo was taken. 

According to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1lnb7cb/stowe_pinnacle_dogs/), Sampson doesn't partake these days. I felt lucky to witness this canine phenom.
