I've hiked Washington a number of times and it never dissapoints. On a nice day, it's hard to take a bad photo. The landscape feels like its begging you to drink it up.

The trails may be crowded, but there's enough mountain for all.

Once you hit the end of tree growth at 4,400 - 4,500 feet, you have about 4 miles left until the summit, if you're the taking Ammonoosuc Ravine trail. On one hand, that's 4 miles where extreme weather could slip in to surprise you. On the other, it's 4 miles of stunning expanse that boggles the mind. 

Enough space for all those who want to hike it.
