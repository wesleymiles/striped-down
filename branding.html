    <h1>Branding</h1>
    <p>Branding is essential to business. It has the magic power of communicating your values, philosophy, reputation, and what customers can expect by using succinct imagery.</p>
    <p>It goes beyond the logo and helps create an identity intended to resonate with your target audience through a combination of messaging and visuals.</p>
    <p>In a world where we incessantly research products before buying, first impressions are key. That initial impact matters. Branding is the promise, but it is your responsibility as a business to back it up with action.</p>
