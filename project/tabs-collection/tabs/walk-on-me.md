AÂ                             B
Sometimes I wonder if you're still here

E                                   D                    A
Lookin' out for anything that could fall and hit your head

A                              B
Flourescent lights burn out in time, dear

E                             D                    A
We see a world in a different light.  Did you give up?

D                           A
Love is supposed to be this bad

D                          A
Make you cry, mega-ultra sad

D                              F# (or F#1)       E
If I told you you're all I ever had, would you walk on me?

          D               E1
Because I wouldn't walk on you.

D            E1       A   G#               F#     E        D
If I was in your shoes I wouldn't walk all over you so

D            E1           F# (or F#1)     B
Please don't walk all over me,           yeah

D            E1      A    G#               F#     E        D
If I was in your shoes I wouldn't walk all over you so

D            E1
Please don't walk all over me.


A E1 F#1
Right now I feel like it's all ending.

Spit me out, sell me cheap.  You'll never ever ever teach me to fly.

In the sky it's early, it's still morning.

All those smiles you made, I wanted to cry cause you gave up.



Love is supposed to be this bad.

Make you cry, stupid-shady sad.

If I told you you're all I ever had, would you walk on me?

Because I wouldn't walk on you.

If I was in your shoes I wouldn't walk all over you so

Please don't walk all over me

If I was in your shoes I wouldn't walk all over you so

Please don't walk all over me.
