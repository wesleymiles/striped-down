Capo 4b
intro Bm
Bm
Everyone's right and no one is sorry
A
That's the start and the end of this story
Bm
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning

Bm A

Bm                             	 
Everyone's right and no one is sorry
A
That's the start and the end of this story
Bm
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning
A
And life is just bets anyway

ref.
Em 	A	G     	D
Look alive, see these bones
Em       	A	G   	D
What you are now, we were once

( and play the same chords (Bm A Bm A in the verse)
Try as they might, no ones immune to
Misfiring and acting on the wrong clues
And thinkin' it's time to redo and redo




Everyone's right and no one is sorry
That's the start and the end of this story
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning

Everyone's right and no one is sorry
That's the start and the end of this story
From the sharks and the jets
To the call in the morning
And life is just bets anyway

Look alive, see these bones
What you are now, we were once

Try as they might, no ones immune to
Misfiring and acting on the wrong clues
And thinkin' it's time to redo and redo

I feel rain in the movies and the talk before the screen lights
I hear strings in the park
I don't like to call or write, except when its too late at night
I mostly just think in the dark

Look alive, see these bones
What you are now, we were once
Just like we are, you'll be dust
And just like we are, permanent

You were too tired to eat, too hungry to sleep
Just imagine the speed, it's just what you need

Look alive, see these bones
What you are now, we were once

And just like we are, you'll be dust
And just like we are, permanent
The lights in the city are more or less blinking
Which side of the story decides what you're thinking
Warm arms and cold faces
We're squinting, we're hurrying
We'll take inventory
We're digging, we're burying

Do you remember when the light was low
Do you remember when it fell
Do you remember when you went to her house, remember ringing the bell

Look alive, see these bones
What you are now, we were once
Just like we are, you'll be dust
Just like we are, permanent

Thanks)


Theres a little 2. guitar playin a part in the verse, its sounds like this:
E---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B----------11-----------------9------------------7--------------9-----------|
G------11-----11-----x2----10---10-----x2------8---8---x2----10---10----x2--|
D-(13)------------13---------------11----------------9----------------11----|
A---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
E---------------------------------------------------------------------------|


Chorus 0:48:
You cant hear the guitar in this part, just some high notes, so you have the choice
playing the following chords as in the verse or you play the chords as power-chords.

//Ab, Db, B, Gb\\


Well, thats it they just repeat the Chorus about 10 times :D



Thats it! I hope this helped, please rate, comment and correct me!

Cheers...
