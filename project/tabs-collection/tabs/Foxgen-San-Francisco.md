Capo on the 1st.  A  E A E  A             E Up in San Francisco where the  A                E forest meets the bridge I  A                 E thought I saw you standing there and  C               D then you fell into the well  But that was many years ago And I am so much older now My brother is a soldier now  C               D I can't see him anyhow a  C              E hilltop in the wind      A             Bm And you, swimming uptide, or just  E               D                 Bm     tuning into radio stations  A  A          E                  Bm     I left my love in San Francisco                              A That's okay, I was bored anyway.              E              Bm     I left my love in the room                               A That's okay, I was born in L.A.  I left my love in San Francisco. That's okay, I was bored anyway. I left my love in a field. That's okay, I was born in L.A.  A  E A E  And we were standing on this hill. Jesus came from Israel. Eyes above a sacred cow So not to wake a sparrow splashing  But that was many years from now and I hope from here on out I always seem to want to shout Your eyes are like a cup of tea Ascending to the sun with me.  You swimming upstream, or just Or just tuning into the new sensations  A I was broken, you were broken  I left my love in San Francisco. That's okay, I was bored anyway. I left my love in the room. That's okay, I was born in L.A.  I left my love in San Francisco. That's okay, I was bored anyway. I left my love in a field. That's okay, I was born in L.A.  A  E A E A7
