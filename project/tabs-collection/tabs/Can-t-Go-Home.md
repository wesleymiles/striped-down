Surrogate - Can't Go Home
Capo II

Riff A:  G|--2-0-2\4--0----|
Riff B:  G|--0-2/4-2--0----| (something like this...)
         
Intro (with hammer-ons on the G string):
Am    (riff a)  Em
Fmaj7 (riff a)  C      (Fmaj7 = xx3210)
Am    (riff a)  Em
Fmaj7 (riff b)  C      (from here on, I refer to the Fmaj7 as an F)

G                              C
they use to make an alcohol as lovely as you
Am                    Em          C
but I ain't had that whiskey for years
G                              C
it's funny all the thing you miss when you can't taste bitterness
Am                    Em          C
you can't taste nothing at all

Am          (riff)             Em
it's gonna take the rest of my life
Em         F(riff)   C 
to get you out of my mind
I know the damage is done
I'm working on a new kind

Chorus:
                      C	               Em
gonna learn that when all the bars are open
                   C                G
cause I can hardly breathe when I'm alone
              Am             Em
they're gonna break away the memory
                     C          G
cause they know that I can't go home

Intro Chords
Humming

repetition takes the fun away from abusing substances
we don't have much fun around here
absolution (G7) comes in bottles all these spirits hard to swallow
they make me walk in my sleep
Am              Em          C
you can't trust nothing you see

it's gonna take the rest of my life
to get you out of my mind
I know the damage is done
I'm working on a new kind

Chorus:
gonna learn that when all the bars are open
cause I can hardly breathe when I'm alone
they're gonna break away the memory cause they know that I can't go home
