F#m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C#m
Tomorrow you’ll see it through

A                         Bm             Bm7<br />
The clouded out disguises put you in the room

E                          D
And though I wandered out alone

A           E              F#m     A<br />
A thousand lights abounded on our home
<br />
<br />
D                     A<br />
And I remember every sound it made

E                                 F#m     A<br />
The clouded out disguises and the grave

D                         A<br />
So yeah I know I’m still afraid

E                               F#m     A    D<br />
Of letting go of choices I have made
<br />
<br />
E
All Delighted people raise their hands
<br />
<br />
F#m                    C#m<br />
And I took you by the sleeve

A                       Bm               D<br />
No other reason than to be your leading man

F#m                     C#m   Cm<br />
And you woke up with a fright

A                          Bm                  D
Our lives depended on the visions through the night

F#m                                 C#m             Cm
Oh we had always, Oh we had always wanted to before

A                           Bm               F#
The hurricane inclined us, grappling on the floor
<br />
<br />
E
All Delighted people raise their hands


F#m                        C#m   Cm
Still the force of nature spurns

A                            Bm            F#
Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement


E
All Delighted people raise their hands


D                      A
And I’m not easily confused

E                                    F#m    A
The trouble with the storm inside us brews

D                      A
But I have so much to give

E                               F#m   A
In spite of all the terror and abuse

(Instrumental)
D (horn notes: D D, A A, F# F#, rest rest)
A (horn notes: E, D C#, B A, F# E)
F  F#m (horn notes: fool around with F#, E, D)
B (horn notes: fool around with F#, E, A)

E
All Delighted people raise their hands

D                         A
And the people bowed and prayed

Bm                           A
And what difference does it make

G                  D
It doesn’t matter anyway

Bm            F#m                E
The world surrounds us with its hate

<br />
F#m                     C#m
Hello darkness, my old friend

A                             Bm                  D
I’ve come to strangle you in spite of what you’d like

F#m                              C#m                         Cm
And don’t be rascal, don’t be a laughing dog…in spite of odds

A                             Bm             F#
All I’m deciphering from the spirits in the light within


E
All delighted people raise their hands


F#m                          C#m   Cm
In restless dreams I walked alone

A                          Bm           F#
The clouded out disguises left me in a dream of lightness


E
All delighted people raise their hands


D                         A
And the people bowed and prayed

C#m                   Bm
To the neon god they made

D                            A
And what difference does it make?

C#m                   Bm
I love you so much anyway

A                            G
And on your breast I gently laid

D                             Bm
Your arms surround me in the lake

      F#m                E  (high E string 5 4 2 4)
I am joined with you forever

I feel alive I feel it glowing in the room
