[Verse 1]


B            E               E7                A
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school, 
F#m           B              E  F#m 
it's a wonder I can think at all. 
    B         E            E7            A         
And though my lack of edu..cation hasn't hurt me none, 
F#m            B              E
I can read the writing on the wall. 
  
CHORUS:   
E   A     C#7  F#                      Bm          E
Kodachro..o....ome, they give us those nice bright colors, 
                 A         D 
they give us the greens of summer, 
                B       E               A    C#7  F#
makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh,  yeah. 
        Bm    E                        A      D
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photo..graph, 
                B       E           A    C#m7 F#m B
so momma, don't take my Kodachrome away..
  
#2.   
B           E               E7              A 
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single, 
    F#m                B              E    F#m 
and brought them all together for one night, 
  B           E              E7            A
I know they'd never match my sweet imagin..ation, 
    F#m              B                  E 
and everything looks worse in black and white. 

CHORUS:   
E   A     C#7  F#                      Bm          E
Kodachro..o....ome, they give us those nice bright colors, 
                 A         D 
they give us the greens of summer, 
                B       E               A    C#7  F#
makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh,  yeah. 
        Bm    E                        A      D
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photo..graph, 
                B       E           A    C#m7 F#m B
so momma, don't take my Kodachrome away..

Mama don't take my Kodachrome away...(Fade.)
