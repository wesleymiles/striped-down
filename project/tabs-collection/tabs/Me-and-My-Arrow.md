Harry Nilsson - Me and My Arrow

Me and my arrow Straighter than narrow Wherever we go, everyone knows It's me and my arrow  / Bbmaj7 - - - / F7 - - - / / Bbmaj7 - - - /  Me and my arrow Taking the high road Wherever we go, everyone knows It's me and my arrow  And in the morning when I wake up She may be gone, I don't know And if we make up just to break up I'll carry on, oh yes I will  / Em7 - A7 - / D - B7 - / Em7 - A7 - / D - B7 Dm7F7 /   {refrain} Me and my arrow, Do-do-loo-do, do-do do-do do do Straighter than narrow Wherever we go, everyone knows It's me and my arrow  Me and my arrow (5X)  {Refrain}
