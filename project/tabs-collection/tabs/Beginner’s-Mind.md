 This is the correct version of Beginner’s Mind that Conor uses live.

Track 8 of The People's Key, Bright Eyes' final album.

Capo 4

D               F#
Hold on tight beginners mind,
   Bm                 A
The wheel is spinning too
Em                    A
Fast to make your move
    F#              Bm
The worst must be assumed
   D                  F#  
Oh how they'll try to pull and pry 
Bm                 A
Away what you know now
Em                   A
Beat and beat it out 
        F#                        Bm
Leave a drum that makes no sound
  G              F#             Em                    A
A snuff film on a Jumbo-tron for all the world to see

  Em              A
A cocktail napkin epitaph
     D            Bm          
Some psychobabble telegram
 Em                    A
Message written in the sand
   D             Bm
The tide rolls in
Em                  A
Swear you'll do the opposite
   D                 Bm
Of all those tangled hypocrites
    Em             A            D                  
Who say that the experiment has failed
Bm
Don't go there
G
You're getting nowhere
A
You're getting nowhere

D                F#
Stay a while my inner child
    Bm                 A
I'd like to learn your trick
Em                      A       
Know what makes you tick

F#                     Bm
Nurse you when you're sick
   D                   F#
Oh how you've grown so cynical
     Bm                       A
Hard lines carved in your face
    Em                A
The sunshine so cliché 
          F#       Bm 
Just like love and pain
    G                     F#                          Em                 A                   
You tried your best on the Rorschach test but there's just nothing to see

     Em            A   
Heard terabytes of perfect pitch
     D                 Bm
Some universal elegance
Em                        A 
Stack the seventh and the fifth
 D            Bm
Along the grid
Em                      A
Swear you’ll be the opposite
   D               Bm
Of all the stilted hypocrites
    Em                 A           D     Bm                    
You know what made you infamous to them, don't you?
G 
You keep starting over
A
You keep starting over
F#
You keep starting over
Bm
You keep starting over
G
Keep starting over
A
Keep starting over

D               F#
Hold on tight beginners mind
      Bm              A 
The currents far too strong
        Em              A
It will carry you along
            F#                 Bm
Till you're just like everyone

D               F#
Stay a while my inner child
    Bm                A
I'd like to learn your trick
Em                      A       
Know what makes you tick
F#                     Bm
Nurse you when you're sick


G F# Em A

The other Capo 1 version of this song has the right tonality, but in the wrong 
Capo position. I use Barre chords on the F#, Bm, G and the A chord for the 
“getting nowhere” and “starting over” lines to give it a fuller sound.
