You know in all of the time that we shared
            G                       Am
I've never been so scared
B                  Bb
Doll me up in my bad luck
Am            D
I'll meet you there
G

I wish I never had taken this dare
G                             Am       
I wasn't quite prepared
B                      Bb
Doll me up in my bad luck
Am            D

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh 
F                       E
Doll me up in my bad luck
Am            D
I'll meet you there...
G
