Capo on 2 (try finger picking to simulate the piano)          D I'm a modern guy         D I don't care much for the go-go            D G or the retro image I see so often                  G D telling me to keep trying                  D maybe you'll get here someday                  D    A keep up the work kid, okay                  A             D I close the book on them right there                   A I see myself change as the days change over             F            A I hear the songs and the words don't change                                    D I write them out of the book right there         (I don't know this bit. Suggest please!) we've been had, you say it's over sometimes I'm just happy I'm older we've been had, I know it's over somehow it got easy to laugh out loud  Other than that you do a repeat of this. Here's the rest of the lyrics out of generosity.  see me age nineteen with some dumb haircut from 1960 moving to New York sitting here with my friends we're all taking the same steps seems foolish now
