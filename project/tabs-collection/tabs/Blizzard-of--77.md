 B|-0-0-0-0-0-7-7-7--8-8-8-8-7-7-7-7--5-5-5-5-5-3-3-3------------------|

 E|----------------------------------------------------3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-|

That last chord may be played this way (sounds much better, I'm only not sure if they 
played it like this):

 In blizzard of '77
 The cars were just lumps on the snow
 And then later
 Tripping in 7-11
 The shelves were stretching out of control

 On a plane ride
 The more it shakes
 The more i have to let go
 Now the signals
 Still getting all mixed up
 We're always doing damage control


    Chorus:

  Am				G
 But in the middle of the night i worry
		  C
 It's blurry even without light
  Am			      G
 In the middle of the night i worry
		  C
 It's blurry even without light


I know i have got a negative edge
That's why i sharpen all the others a lot
It's like flowers or ladybugs
Pretty weeds or red beetles with dots

    Chorus.


Outro:

	C - C/B - Am - G

I miss you more than i knew...
