[Verse 1]
What is love if you got in between it
No one cares if you’re ever gonna achieve it
And nobody knows
Nobody knows
And what do we care if they always fuck with us
They want us to break
But who cares they don’t know us
And still we don’t know
And still we don’t know

[Chorus]
So I say whoa
Can you let us all go
And if I ever tried to break away
I know [?]
And no one knows
Nobody knows

[Verse 2]
What is life if you can’t even run it
Try to maintain who you are but you’re fronting
And everyone knows
Everyone knows

And who am I to run away from things I can’t even explain
And no one knows
Nobody knows

Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
So I say whoa
Can you let us all go
And if I ever tried to break away
I know [?]
And no one knows
Nobody knows

[Verse 3]
What is love if you’re got in between it
No one cares if you’re ever gonna achieve it
And nobody knows
Nobody knows
And what do we care if they always fuck with us
They want us to break
But who cares they don’t know us
And still we don’t know
And still we don’t know

[Chorus]
So I say whoa
Can you let us all go
And if I ever tried to break away
I know [?]
And no one knows
Nobody knows
