Beach Fossils - Careless

NO CAPO  INTRO: A - Amaj7 - A - Amaj7  A         Amaj7          A/D  Dmaj7 A/D I live so much inside my head A            Amaj7            A/D  Dmaj7 A/D And all this feelings, all my fears A            Amaj7        A/D  Dmaj7 A/D So what it's happening to me,         A               Amaj7 And the time is so, the time is so,     A/D The time is so much that I can see.  Amaj7 - Dmaj7 (REPEAT) ***  A               Amaj7         A/D   Dmaj7 A/D And I hear your shines in the street, A              Amaj7         A/D   Dmaj7 A/D But I couldn't go against my dreams A          Amaj7           A/D  Dmaj7 A/D So if it's carelessness we need          A                Amaj7 Whatever doesn't mean so, doesn't mean so A/D Doesn't mean so much when it’s just clean.  A - Amaj7 - Dmaj7 (REPEAT) ***  A                            A/D Sometimes I'm hanging by the flight Amaj7                        Dmaj7 I'll follow these memories I share A                      A/D I let my heart feel no regrets Amaj7                    Dmaj7 I feel so careless in my head.  Amaj7 - Dmaj7 (REPEAT)
