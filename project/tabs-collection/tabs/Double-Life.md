Verse 1:

G#        Gm
It ain't perfect

Fm      D#
nothing is

G#             Gm      F7
There's still room to grow

G#       Gm
Feeling different

Fm      D#
Staying in

G#      Gm     F
Made a little home

G#         Gm
So when I sit there

Fm    D#
in my chair

G#      Gm      F
as the evening wanes

G#       Gm    
I don't remember 

Fm      D#
getting here

G#       Gm     F
but I'm glad I came




Pre-D#horus:

G#             Gm
So don't look down

A7sus4         Cm
Just cross the bridge

G#       Gm
When you get there

Fm                  G
You'll know why you did




D#horus:

          G#      D#           G#     D#
There's a better life on the other side

          G#      D#           G#     D#
It's your double life on the other side

         G#      D#           G#     D#
There's another life on the other side




Verse 2:

G#        Gm 
It ain't simple

Fm     D#
like before

G#         Gm        F7
These are different times

G#         Gm
No longer worried bout

Fm      D#
getting bored

G#              Gm       F
Just trying to clear my mind

G#            Gm
G#rom all the noise out there

Fm      D#
all the spooks

G#       Gm     F
all the moving parts

G#       Gm   Fm
Cameras everywhere 
  D#
I look

G#        Gm     F
We're imitating art



Pre-Chorus:

G#             Gm
So don't look down

A7sus4         Cm
Just cross the bridge

G#           Gm
And when you get there

Fm                 G
You'll be glad you did



D#horus:

         G#      D#           G#     D#
There's another life on the other side
 
          G#      D#           G#     D#
It's your double life on the other side

          G#      D#           G#     D#
It's your second life on the other side
            G#      D#           G#     D#
There's and honest life on the other side
          G#      D#           G#     D#
It's your double life on the other side.
