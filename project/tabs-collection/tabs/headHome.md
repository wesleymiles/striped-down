[intro]  Gm  C  Bb

[verse]
       Dm
No one seems to be around
                   Bb              
Today they must've all gone off
            Dm
without me again
                  Bb
I think I'll head home

           Dm
Maybe I'll find them
                   Bb              
gathered 'round my doorstep
    Dm
Oh, to sleep
                 Gm  C  Dm
in a comfortable bed
                  Gm  C  Dm
I think I'll head home

Bb  Gm  Bb  Bb

       Dm
No one seems to be around
                   Bb
Today they must've all gone off
            Dm
without me again
                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me
                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me

Bb
Bring me a day full of honest work
and a roof that never leaks
        F
I'll be satisfied

Bb
Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
       F
During harvest time

            Bb
But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
            Dm
She reads Leviathan

                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me
                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me
                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me

[solo]


Bb
Bring me a day full of honest work
and a roof that never leaks
        F

Bb
Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
       F
During harvest time

            Bb
But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
            Dm
She reads Leviathan

                  Bb   Dm
I think I'll head ho---me (repeat)
