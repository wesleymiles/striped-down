B         d               G

   I feel it all, I feel it all

   The wings are wide, the wings are wide
B                 a*                   G        B                                       
   Wild card in sight, wild card in sight

G               G                      a
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart
        a
I'll be the one to hope
                

d                      G
Can I know more than I knew before
B             a*               G        
   I know more than I knew before
B             a*               G 
   I didn't rest, I didn't stop
B             a*               G       B
   Did we fight or did we talk

G               G                      a
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart
        a  
I'll be the one to hope

d          	        G        d     B
   Can I love you more
d             G     G           d     B    
I love you more
d             G     G           d     B  
I don't know what I knew before
d                      G          G            B  
But now I know I want to win the war



e                  
No one likes to take a test
Sometimes we don't pull or flex
G
Put your weight against the door
Kick-drum on the basement floor
e
Stranded in the thought of woods
Looking like the winter bird
G
On my head the water pours
Cops stream through the open door

a
Fly away   
a                     G
Fly away the one who want to make

   d                      G
I feel it all    I feel it all
B     a*                G
     I feel it all    I feel it all
B        a*                G
   The wings are wide   The wings are wide
B        a*                G                B
   Wild card in sight, wild card in sight

G              G                          a
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart
a              a                          G
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
G              G                          a
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
a
I'll end it, though you started it

d                   G
   The truth, the lies
B         a*        G                                   B
   The truth, the lies     (..etc, repeat as necessary)
