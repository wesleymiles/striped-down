I used to see the night so anxious, but now I know
         G - A              D
The only thing it ever taught me was a grand illusion
                             G            G - A              D
That comes and goes, the city blanketed of snow.

Bm           G    D 
What if we die, no end and no conclusion.
Bm           G    D 
How could you smile, just walk away.
Intro riff                 G - A
Well I don't know. I don't know.

D                                                              G  
I met you at the railroad station, now years ago.
        G  G - A                              D                                                    G
And something happened on the night I last drank with you in the neon glow.
                    G  G - A       D
Now I don't see you anymore.


Bm           G    D 
The Midwestern sky, is gray and cold.
Bm           G    D 
The sun never shines, but that's alright.
Bm           G    D 
And I couldn't find the letters that you wrote me.
Bm           G    D                                      G               G
What did you write? Where'd you go, well I don't know. No.

D
Take a little time gonna roll the dice
				G      Gm
Taken for a ride, any normal life will do, too.
D
Find another way, try to break the ice
				          G          Gm
Every day and night, the banana peels were true (?). True.
