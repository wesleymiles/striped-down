[Verse 1]
Every afternoon
You set your stuff down on the table
I wonder what you're up to now
Father isn't able

[Hook]
It's coming back to me
The morning dark's hollow sound
But the day's almost over
It's been a long time
That love's no longer mine
But it's still yours
In a fable
In a fable
They say things on how I'm supposed to be
I'm nodding yes you know I don't agree

[Hook 2]
Just in a fable
Just in a fable
When love is gone you pack your things and leave
