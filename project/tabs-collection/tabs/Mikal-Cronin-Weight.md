I’ve been starting over for a long time
I’m not ready for another day
I feel, I feel renewed
Time is right, I’m only getting older
I’m not ready for the second wave
The way you’ve seen it through
Don’t be bolder, golden life of mine
Sing for love, full force in my life
I’m not ready for the way you dance

Tie the money hold on for a long time
There’s an answer for another man
I’m yet to find the way
Wasting years or waiting for a savior
I’m not made up for the simple path
Don’t take it day by day
Don’t be bolder, golden life of mine
Sing for love, full force in my life
I’m not ready for the boulder
I’m not ready for the dry cut jeans
I’m not ready for the sirens
I’m not ready for the fear and shame
I’m not ready for the waking
Take me from myself

From myself
Holding on to something I don’t know

I’ve been starting over for a long time
I’m not ready for the second wave
The way you’ve seen me cry.
