Capo 2

Intro: C Am E G x2

C               Am  E              G
 In the suburbs I,    I learned to drive
         C                     Am    E                    G
 And you told me we’d never survive,   grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving

C Am E G

C                     Am    E          G
 You always seemed so sure,   That one day we’d be fighting
C              Am    E             G
 In a suburban war,   your part of town against mine
           C                        Am     E           G
 I saw you standing on the opposite shore,  but by the time the first bombs fell
 C               Am     E                  G
 We were already bored,   We were already, already bored

Chorus:
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                C     Am E G
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again

     C                Am     E           G
 The kids wanna be so hard,    but in my dreams we’re still screaming
     C                   Am     E                G
 And running through the yard,   when all of the walls that they built in the 
 C                 Am     E                G
 Seventies finally fall,    And all of the houses they built in the
 C                 Am                          E                 G
 Seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all,  meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

Chorus:
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                     C               Am E G
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling and into the night

C Am E G

C                      Am  E              G                        C     Am
 So can you understand,      why I want a daughter while I’m still young
           E                  G
 I want to hold her hand, and show her some beauty
   C                       Am    E             G
 Before all this damage is done,   but if it’s too much to ask
         C                Am                E    G
 If it’s too much to ask,    then send me a son

C                    Am  E                G
 Under the overpass,       in the parking lot we’re still waiting
      C               Am E              G
 It’s already passed,      so move your feet from hot pavement
     C              Am                     E                   G
 And into the grass,    cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past

Chorus:
C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
C            Am               E           D                C     Am
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again

E           D                C     Am
 I’m moving past the feeling again
E           D                C     Am
 I’m moving past the feeling again

C Am E G
C Am E
       G                        C    Am E
 In my dreams we’re still screaming
G                 C    Am E 
 We’re still screaming
G                 C    Am E G
 We’re still screaming

Capo 2

Intro: B5

C G Em Am x2

C                          G D/F#
Businessmen drink my blood
         Em                                 Am
Like the kids in art school said they would
      C                            G D/F#
And I guess I'll just begin again
Em                              Am
You say can we still be friends

Chorus:
C          D      C/B
  If I was scared, I would
C              D      G        D/F#
  And if I was bored, you know I would
C              D                  Em   D
  And if I was yours, but I'm not


C                               G D/F#
All the kids have always known
         Em                        Am
That the emperor wears new clothes
       C                          G D/F#
But to bow to down to them anyway
   Em                      Am
Is better than to be alone


Chorus

C                               G D/F#
Now you're knocking at my door
       Em                                Am
Saying please come out against the night
    C                        G D/F#
But I would rather be alone
Em                          Am
Than pretend I feel alright

       C                           G D/F#
If the businessmen drink my blood
         Em                                 Am
Like the kids in art school said they would
       C                           G D/F#
Then I guess I'll just begin again
Em                              Am
You say can we still be friends

Chorus:
C          D      C/B
  If I was scared, I would
C              D     G        D/F#
  And if I was pure, you know I would
C              D                  Em
  And if I was yours, but I'm not
  D/F#             C
  Now I'm ready to start

C          D
  If I was scared, I would
C              D     G        D/F#
  And if I was pure, you know I would
C              D                  Em
  And if I was yours, but I'm not
  D/F#             C     Em
 Now I'm ready to start

D/F#             C     Em
Now I'm ready to start
D/F#              C     Em
I would rather be wrong
     D/F#                   C
Than live in the shadows of your song
           Em
My mind is open wide
    D/F#             C     Em 
And now I'm ready to start
    D/F#             C
And now I'm ready to start
           Em
My mind is open wide
    D/F#             C
And now I'm ready to start
                 Em
Your mind surely opened the door
   D/F#              C    Em
To step out into the dark
D/F#
Now I'm ready

        B            B/A     B/C#       F#m          E
But I'm beginning to have my doubts, my doubts about it

E  A E A A E A

E                  A           E
When you're hiding underground
    B          B/A     B/C#  F#m
The rain can't get you wet
    E                 A        E
But do you think your righteousness 
              B        B/A     B/C#            F#m     E
Could pay the interest on your debt, I have my doubts about it

E  A E A A E A 

Chorus

  E                   A      E
I feel like I've been living in
               A           E
A city with no children in it
                  A    E
A garden left for ruin by
    B    B/A      B/C#        F#m     E
And by as I hide inside of my private prison

7. Half Light I
===============

Intro: C Em F Dm

C
 You told us that
Em
 We were too young
           F
 Now that,  night's closing in
            Dm
 And in the half light, we run

C
 Lock us up safe
Em
 And hide the key
          F
 But the,   night tears us loose
           Dm
And in the half light, we're free

C Em F Dm

C
 Strange how the half light
Em
 Can make a place new
           F
 You can't   recognize me
             Dm
 And I can't    recognize you

    C
 We run through the streets
Em
 That we know so well
         F
 And the   houses hide so much
              Dm
 We're in the half light
                G
 None of us can tell
                          C
 They hide the ocean in a shell
G               C     G
 The ocean in a shell

F
 Our heads are just houses
Dm
 Without enough windows
             F
 They say you  hear human voices
          G            C
 But they    only echo

G           C
 They only echo
G           C
 They only echo
G      C   G
 Only echo
 
        C                     G
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
        C                     G
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
        C                     G
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
        C                     G
 We are not listening, we are on the streets

Now that San Francisco's gone, I guess I'll just pack it in

E           B                  A        A/Ab        E
Even in the half light, we can see that something's gotta give

E B A A/Ab E x2

E                   B                  A           E
When we watched the markets crash, the promises we made were torn
E               B            A        A/Ab       E
Then my parents sent for me, from out west where I was born
 
E B A A/Ab E

Abm              B
 Some people say, they've already lost
Abm                    F#      E    B
 But they're afraid to pay the cost 
         A           E
For what we've lost

Pay the cost for what we've lost

E                 B             A      A/Ab  E
Now that you have left me here, I will never raise my voice
E                B              A       A/Ab         E
All the diamonds you have here, in this moment which has no life

E B A A/Ab E

E                 B                A             E
All the seas have changed so much, since I was a little child
E                   B                A        A/Ab E
Pray to god I won't live to see, the death of everything that's wild, wooh

E B A A/Ab E x2

E                   B               A        A/Ab    E
Though we knew this day would come, still it took us by surprise
E                  B             A       A/Ab      E
In this town where I was born, I now see through a dead man's eyes

E              B               A    A/Ab  E
 One day they,   will see it's long gone

        C/E        Dm                       C/E          F

C/E Dm C/E F

     C/E       Dm           C/E         F
This town's so strange they built it to change
    C/E      Dm                               C/E       F
And while we sleep we know its streets were rearranged
C/E    Dm               C/E         F
My old friends, can't remember when
  C/E       Dm              C/E       F
Before your war against the suburbs began
  C/E      Dm    C/E   F
Before it began

Now the music divides us into tribes

Grew your hair so I'll grew mine

So the past won't rest , till you jump the fence and leave it behind

C/E    Dm               C/E           F
My old friends, I can remember when

You cut your hair, I never saw you again
        C/E       Dm               C/E     F
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars
      C/E          Dm           C/E     F
And I searched for you in every passing car

F    G          Am    G
 The nights are warm
F          G          Am    G
 Yeah, the nights are warm, I've been
F             G               Am    G
Living in the shadows of your song

Living in the shadows of your,    song

In the suburbs I, I learned to drive

You told me we would never survive,

So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight

But we started a war that we can't win
        C/E             Dm             C/E        F
We keep erasing all the streets we grew up in

10. Month of May
================

One two three four!

Intro: B5

B5
Gonna make a record in the month of May

In the month of May, in the month of May
E5                         G5
Gonna make a record in the month of May
         A5                     B5
When the violent wind blows the wires away


Month of May, it's a violent thing

In the city their hearts start to sing
      E5                  G5
Well, some people singing sounds like screaming
A5                    B5
 Used to doubt it but now I believe it


Month of May, everybody sing love

In the city, watch it from above
    E5                      G5
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
A5                         B5
 The violent wind blew the wires away

We were shocked in the suburbs


Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight

The kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
      E5                       G5
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
        A5                                 B5
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
       E5                       G5
I said some things are pure and some things are right
        A5                        B5
But the kids are still with their arms folded tight

So young, so young

So much pain for someone so young, well
E5                    G5
 I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
    A5                              B5
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight


First            of the town

That's why we're still driving around
     E5                    G5
And around and around and around and around
     A5                    B5
And around and around and around and around (And around and around and around and around)


Two-thousand nine, two-thousand ten

Wanna make a record how I felt then
       E5                   G5
When I stood outside in the month of May
                A5                    B5
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away


If I died in the month of May

Let the wind take my body away, then
E5             G5
 Wish I may or I wish I might
        A5                         B5
You can meet me down there with my arms folded tight

B5
Start again in the month of May       |
                                      |
Start again in the month of May       |
                                      | x3
Come on and blow the wires away       |
                                      |
Come on and blow the wires away       |

11. Wasted Hours
================

Artist: Arcade Fire
Song: Wasted Hours
Album: The Suburbs

Capo 4

Intro: G

G
All those wasted hours we used to know
Bm               Em              C
Spent the summer staring out the window
                                        G
The wind it takes you where it wants to go


First they built the road, then they built the town
Bm                     Em                C
That's why we're still driving round and round
                                                G
And all we see, are kids in buses longing to be free

Chorus:
G                           G/B
Wasted hours, before we knew
Am       Em      G         G/B
Where to go, and what to do
Am     Em          G        Csus2
Wasted hours, that you made new
    Em     Bm                       G
And turned into, a life that we can live

G
Some cities make you lose your head
Bm              Em                     C
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
                           G
And what was that line you said


Wishing you were anywhere but here
    Bm                    Em         C
You watch the life you're living disappear
                                                      G
And now I see we're still kids in buses longing to be free

Em                     Dsus4 D
Here, are my place and time

And here in my own skin, I can finally begin

Let the century pass me by
               G            C            B7        Em
Standing under night sky, tomorrow means nothing

               G                    C              B7          Em
Feeling barely alive when I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
                Dsus4       D
And prayed to a dying star
             G             C       B7
The memory's fading I can almost remember singing

Chorus:
Em     D      G     C

Dsus4 D G C B7

Em                        Dsus4   D
We watched the end of the century
                G              C           B7           Em
Compressed on a tiny screen, a dead star collapsing and we could see
                   Dsus4 D
That something was ending
                G                      C            B7        Em
Are you through pretending, we saw its signs in the suburbs

D G C B7

Em                      Dsus4   D
You could never have predicted
                  G                 C         B7             Em
That he could see through you, Kasparov, Deep Blue, nineteen-ninety six
                    Dsus4      D
Your mind's pulling tricks now
                    G                 C             B7
The show is over so take a bow, we're living in the shadows

Chorus:
Em     D      G     C
la, la la, la la la la
Em     D      G     B7
La la, la la, la la la

Hey, put the cellphone down for a while

In the night there is something wild

Can you hear it breathing?

And hey, put the laptop down for a while

13. We Used to Wait
===================

Capo 3

C/G: 332010

Intro: Am

          Am
I used to write
                C/G       F               C
I used to write letters I used to sign my name
          Am
I used to sleep at night
                    C/G            F          C
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain

                   Am
But by the time we met
               C/G     F                 C
By the time we met the times had already changed

Am C/G F C

                   Am
So I never wrote a letter
                C/G          F              C
I never took my true heart I never wrote it down
                       Am
So when the lights cut out
           C/G             F          C
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Bridge:
D5                C        Am
Now our lives are changing fast
D5                C        Am
Now our lives are changing fast
G                   Em       D5
Hope that something pure can last
G                   Em       A5
Hope that something pure can last

       Am
But it seems strange
               C/G      F           C
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
                    Am
But what's stranger still
                    C/G       F         C
Is how something so small can keep you alive
           Am
We used to wait
                 C/G        F        C
We used to waste hours just walking around
                Am
We used to wait
                 C/G          F          C
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

Chorus:
Am  C      C/G     Am
    Ooh we used to wait
    C      C/G     F
    Ooh we used to wait
G   C      C/G     Am
    Ooh we used to wait (Sometimes it never came)
    C      C/G     Am
    Ooh we used to wait (Sometimes it never came)
    C      C/G     F           G                  C
    Ooh we used to wait (Still moving through the pain)

    Ooh

          Am
I'm gonna write 
                 C/G         F             C
A letter to my true love I'm gonna sign my name
                    Am
Like a patient on a table
              C/G        F                C
I wanna walk again gonna move through the pain

Bridge:
D5                C        Am
Now our lives are changing fast
D5                C        Am
Now our lives are changing fast
G                   Em       D5
Hope that something pure can last
G                   Em       Am
Hope that something pure can last

Chorus:
              Am    C
   We used to wait

   We used to wait

  Now we're screaming,  sing the chorus again
Am           C           Am            C
  We used to wait for it,   We used to wait for it

Capo 3

Fdim: 1231xx

Intro: Am

Am                    Dm
Took a drive into the sprawl
            C                           F
To find the house where we used to stay in
Em                 Am                  G F     
 Couldn't read the number in the dark
               G                   Fdim  Em
You said let's save it for another day

Am                    Dm
Took a drive into the sprawl
            C                      F
To find the places we used to play
Em                    Am        G    F
 It was the loneliest day of my life
               G                   Fdim     Em
You're talking at me but I'm still far away

Am                              Dm
Let's take a drive, through the sprawl
              C                           F
Through these towns they built to change
Em                  Am           G     F
 Then you said, the emotions are dead
        G                       Fdim     Em
It's no wonder that you feel so strange

Am                                 Dm
Cops showing their lights, on the reflectors of our bikes
                  C                     F
Said, do you kids know what time it is?
        Em                                   Am           G    F
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
       G                      Fdim Em
Like I have something to give

Am                        Dm
 The last defender of the sprawl
           C                       F
Said, well where do you kids live?
        Em                           Am        G      F
Well sir, if you only knew, what the answer is worth
     G               Fdim          Em
Been searching every corner of the earth

15. Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)
==========================================

Capo 3


Intro: C

C                                         Am
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
                                  F              C
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
                                     Am
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
                               F           C
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface

                                      Am
'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
                                F         C
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
                       F            C
That we can never get away from the sprawl


Chorus:
F             C
Living in the sprawl
F             C               F                C          C/B
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
            Am
And there's no end in sight
                             F              C
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

C                                Am
We rode our bikes to the nearest park
                         F             C
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
                                   Am
We shield our eyes from the police lights
                    F          C
We run away, but we don't know why

                                    Am
On the black river, the city lights shine
                                  F         C
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
                       F            C
That we can never get away from the sprawl


Chorus

Eb Cm Eb G

C                                         Am
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
                                  F              C
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
                                     Am
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
                 F            C
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?

Chorus

C Am

                             F              C
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

C Am E G x3

C                        Am
 If I could have it back
E        G
 All the time that we wasted
C                        Am
 I'd only waste it again
E                         G
 If I could have it back
              C                 Am
 You know I'd love to waste it again

 Waste it again and again and again

C Am

E                G
 I've got to ask
C            Am
 Sometimes I can't believe it
E           D                 C
 I'm moving past the feeling again
             Am
 Sometimes I can't believe it
E           D                C
 I'm moving past the feeling again

 Sometimes I can't believe it
