Milk Thistle - Conor Oberst (and the Mystic Valley Band)


CAPO: 4th Fret

Intro: C  Bm
       C D G
       C D Em
       C  D

C              Bm
Milk thistle, milk thistle,
C      D    G
Let me down slow,
C       D    Em
Help me go slow,
        C          D
I've been carryin' on,
       C            G
I'm not scared of nothin',
           C          G
I'll go pound for pound,
      C         G
I keep death on my mind,
      C       D
Like a heavy crown.
     C     D
If I go to heaven,
      C         D
I'll be bored as hell,
      C       D
Like a little baby,
     Am             G
At the bottom of a well.


(At the end of a verse hammer on to the 3rd fret of the A string – so when you get to 
you play the bass string (E:-3-) then hammer on (A:-2h3-) then play the bass string again 
it’s really simple and obvious when you listen to the song.)


C           Bm
Fair child, fair child,
C   D       G
How are you man?
       C      D    Em
Did you fix that storefront?
       C           D
Did you start that band?
        C          G
Don't be scared of nothin',
      C         G
You go pound for pound,
            C           G
You'll bring peace to midnight,
      C        D
Like a spotted owl.
      C          D
I'll be rootin' for you,
       C        D
Like my favourite team,
       C      D
If somebody sweats you,
      Am             G
You just point 'em out to me.


(Same hammering on as in the first verse)


(This next bit, along with most of the C Em Am parts is just the A string (A: -3-2-0- ))


C Em
Am
All the sights and sounds,
B11
This little world's too crowded now,
           C**     D          G (Hammering as usual)
And there's only one way out.
C Em
Am
An elevator ride,
B11
Through the tunnel towards the light,
       C**   D        G (Hammering)
And I’m nowhere bound,
          C   Em  D
Keep going up and down,
C  Em  G (B)
Up and down.


C          Bm
Newspaper, newspaper
     C     D  G
Can't take no more,
          C  D    Em
You're here every morning,
      C       D
Waitin' at my door.
        C          G
I'm just tryin' to kiss you,
       C       G
And you stab my eyes,
      C        G
Make me blue forever,
       C      D
Like an Island sky.
       C        D
And I'm not pretending,
        C      D
That it's all okay,
           C        D
Just let me have my coffee,
         Am              G (Hammering)
Before you take away the day.


C        Bm
Lazarus, Lazarus,
C      D     G
Why all the tears?
C   D    Em
Did your faithful chauffer
C         D
Just disappear?
      C          G
What a lonesome feeling,
     C           G
To be just waitin' round,
       C            G
Like some washed up actress,
    C      D
In a Tinseltown.
   C        D
But for the record,
       C          D
I'd come pick you up,
          C        D
We'll head for the ocean,
        Am                G (Hammering)
Just say when you've had enough.


C Em
Am
All the light and sound,
B11
This little world's too fragile now,
            C**    D         G (Hammering)
And there's only one way out.
C Em
Am
But if you let me slide,
B11
I'll do my best to make things right,
       C**  D        G (Hammering)
And I’m nowhere bound,
           C  Em   D
Keep going up and down,
C  Em   G
Up and down.


C             Bm
Milk thistle, milk thistle,
C   D      G
Let me down slow,
   C     D      Em
Just help me go slow,
         C         D
I've been hurrying on.
     C          G
I was poised for greatness,
     C         G
I was down and out
      C            G
I keep death at my heels
      C       D
Like a basset hound
    C       D
If I go to heaven,
      C        D
I'll be bored as hell,
      C        D
Like a crying baby,
     Am            G (No hammering)
At the bottom of a well.
