Standard Tuning

022100
x46654
466444
x24442
244222

that's for the intro and then for the verse:

x24400
244200
x02200
022100

but holy shit I'm just a dork:

244222
x46654
466444

oh well part (the blues kind of strumming thing) without my guitar I'm lost!



Moves right past me:
x24400
x02200

Making plans with my friends:
x46654
466444
244222
x46654

I know that (some word) It's a little late to let me down:
244222
x24442
244222
x24442
022100

The Oh no, I better go part is a bit hard to figure out without a guitar but I think it might be:
022100
244200
466400
577600
244200
466400
577600
466400
244200
244200
022100

This movie's gotta end
x24400
244200
x02200
022100

OK I have a guitar now:

The dork (or door, whatever [how can he be a door, I really don't understand this, explain!]) part is actually:

244222

x46654

466444

how stupid of me!

and the strumming part I wasn't sure of is these two chords (you can figure out the rhythm, I'm sure):

x02xxx and x04xxx

well, probably not exactly that, but the A powerchord playd with that blues-kind-of-thing thing. You know.

Otherwise I think it's pretty close.


Oh yeah, and the chords after "moves right past me" are of course:

244200

022100

And the first two chords in "making plans with my friends" should be in reverse order.

I'm so dumb. Sorry.


All of a sudden I
Lost the lie
I let myself believe
I'd be a brand new guy
But holy shit I'm just a door
Well...
I helped you to see out
Of your hole
Got the gas on in you're house
Because you turned to cold
When you back up on
Your feet
You'll move right past me
You're makin' plans with my friends
I know they're great
It's a little late to let me down
Oh no... I better go
You set the tone
You just don't know
You're scratching it in stone
I better wash my clothes
Take a bath
Move up and down the hall
Untill I find my class
So I can be myself again
This movie has gotta end... (x3)
Do do..
Do do do do do do(x3)
This movie has gotta end... (x5)
Oh... Yeah...(x4) (fades out)
