    <h1>Wobblies’ <span>timeline</span></h1>
    <p>Inspired and sourced from the graphic novel: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384897.Wobblies_A_Graphic_History_of_the_Industrial_Workers_of_the_World">Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World</a>, which features a different comic artist for each subject/era, and also by <a href="https://colly.com">colly.com</a>’s timeline, I made this page to tell the story of the famous labor union’s prominent figures.</p>
    <p>What struck me was each artist’s unique tribute to the legendary fighters. To not let them drip from my mind sieve, I snapped photos as a way to help remember their stories, before returning the book to library. </p>

Despite being targeted for her activism, she is later falsely accused by the FBI of being responsible for the bombing. In 1989 she organizes a successful campaign to save California’s Headwaters Forest from logging. <sup><a href="#fn13" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="ref13"></a></sup></p>
