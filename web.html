        <h1>Web design</h1>
        <p>See some sites I made. I've designed in-house, through an agency, or through freelance. Although the heading says web <strong><em><u>design</u></em></strong>, each project required <em>some</em> front-end dev on my part.</p>
        <!-- <p>Today’s tech makes it easier than ever to do it yourself. But actually sitting in front of a screen and getting a site up and running is still a lot. Folks tend to appreciate having someone who knows the ropes. Decisions like what to work on next and what can wait until after launch aren’t straightforward.</p> -->

    <p>Charter invested in branding before coming to us, and it shows. Commitment to the direction of the brand is what makes this site successful. Our story was anchored in a nautical theme, and we used supporting metaphors and imagery.</p>

    <p>The challenge: design a site with a heart logo without feeling "soft." The solution was to lean into the red color through a dark-mode lens. Going light with red gets you pink. Our palette was a variety of greys with a highlight or red. The angles bring a sturdiness to the site.</p>

    <p>One constraint at the agency was solely using google fonts. Here, I sneak in a graphic of script font in a few places. The mobile design was considered upfront, during the creation of the pattern library. So, when a dev builds something like this, the responsive breakdowns are mostly complete.</p>

    <p>We don’t see many serif fonts in this industry, so this was a bit of a novelty. Designs are created in adobe XD and take advantage of their ‘smart’ components, colors, and character styles. View the site to see animations like the truck sliding in.</p>

    <p>The client did the branding internally. I matched the trucks to the site by bringing in the curves from the logo. The site adhered to conversion principles in many places: a promotion is offered for filling out the Mini form, trust icons high on the page, photos of actual happy customers, and custom photos throughout.</p>

    <p>Great branding is not just a logo, but a toolbox of aligned design elements. This client came to us with a heavy toolbox. We employed these themes: wavy-line separators, sunbursts, subtle textures, a mascot in color and monotone, and a cursive font.</p>
