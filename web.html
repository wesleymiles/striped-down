    <p>Big company, big projects, big UX decisions. I worked closely with content strategists and collaborated with a larger UX team, of which engineers were embedded.</p>

    I've been dedicated to this project for 2+ years. A small team of designers and I look after this site. I've seen it through:
    <ul>
      <li>A transition to this new domain, from where it used to be on the customer portal</li>
      <li>The migration of new content, because this domain is the new spot for learning for the company, in addition to docs</li>
      <li>Applying dark-mode</li>
      <li>Co-leading two in-person research studies at our yearly <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit">summit</a> event</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The project's goal was to highlight a new product by simplifying. Previously, we featured 50 products here. This adjustment moved them to the All products page, leaving the three platforms and a spot for a highlightable product. We had data that the All products page was highly clicked from this section previously and making that move meant less governance for maintainers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark section above used to be all white. In the first phase the cards did not break out of their container. The data after launching showed us that engagement was low&mdash;a small, cheap adjustment of nudging them up brought those numbers back up.
