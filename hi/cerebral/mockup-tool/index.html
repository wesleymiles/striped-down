			<h3>Situation</h3>
			<p>Our agency sent clients design mockups in a PDF format to review. This lead to the following problems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Unprofessional</strong>. The PDF stretched to whatever screen you had.</li>
				<li><strong>Confusion</strong> lead to questions that fell on CX.</li>
				<li><strong>No archive</strong> or record of mockups.</li>
				<li><strong>Not scalable</strong>. Digging through emails never is.</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>Process</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Research:
				<ul>
					<li>Found a 3rd party service that solved problem for a while, then it went under.</li>
					<li>I used their idea, took initiative to create one in-house.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Built Prototype: HTML holder for 4 mockups, FTP back-end for designers to use.</li>
			<li>Beta test: Sent early version to a few clients and CX members for feedback.</li>
				<p>Sought out advice and critique from design team. </p>

				<caption>Early version used one URL, but had no nav bar. Internal feedback said it wasn't easy enough to navigate around.</caption>

			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>A bundle of static mockups with an interface and talking-points to set the stage. </p>
			<p>This can be used to send to the client or as a tools while presenting the design.</p>
	<h4>Why this solution works</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It puts each round of design into one URL</li>
	<li>It puts the mockup in a realistic setting</li>
	<li>It builds on conventions in the industry</li>
</ul>

	<h4>What would I change?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Improve UX for designers, from FTP</li>
	<li>Make menu dynamic if you want to swap pages depending on project</li>
	<li>Include a send as text option so you can see it on your phone</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Problem: Hard for client to review their mockup again</h4>
<p>4 links usually means 4 new browser tabs. This can be hard difficult for the non-computer savvy user. Itâ€™s not as professional of a system as we can make it.</p>
<h4>Solution: New interface</h4>
<p>A friendly way for clients to navigate through mockups. Every project will have 1 main link, as a homebase. </p>


<h4>Problem: Giving design feedback is hard</h4>
<p>Clients are put into a place where they might not know how to express themselves. This might be their first situation having to discuss design. The better we understand their vision, the the better we can design it.</p>
<h4>Solution: Tips for effective feedback</h4>
<p>Add short suggestions for giving feedback to the intro page or to the client directly.</p>


	<h4>Metrics for success</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> We received almost immediate positive feedback from the 2 stakeholders: CX and clients.</li>
		<li><strong>Saved time for CX</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>No more troubleshooting PDFs</li>
				<li>Reinforced repeated talking points</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Used on 250+ designs & counting</li>
	</ul>
