.eleventy.js
- Main Configuration Hub
- What goes here:
	- Plugins 
	- Import/require other config files
	- Global settings (template formats, markdown config)
	- Core filters that are site-wide utilities (like postDate, parseElevation)
	- Shortcodes
	- Passthrough copy
	
	
taxonomies.js
- Content Classification System, the filing system and label maker
- What goes here:
	- Collections that group content (artists, venues, peaks, states, towns)
	- Filters specific to those taxonomies (primaryArtist, allArtists, formatPeaks)
	- Helper functions for taxonomy data transformation
	- Anything that answers "what are all the X in my content?"
	
	
Future? 
"Is this about processing images?" → images.js (or keep in .eleventy.js if small)
