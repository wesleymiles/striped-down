.eleventy.js
- Main Configuration Hub
- What goes here:
	- Plugins 
	- Import/require other config files
	- Global settings (template formats, markdown config)
	- Core filters that are site-wide utilities (like postDate, parseElevation)
	- Shortcodes
	- Passthrough copy
	
	
taxonomies.js
- Content Classification System, the filing system and label maker
- What goes here:
	- Collections that group content (artists, venues, peaks, states, towns)
	- Filters specific to those taxonomies (primaryArtist, allArtists, formatPeaks)
	- Helper functions for taxonomy data transformation
	- Anything that answers "what are all the X in my content?"
- How it works
	- Collections are created in src/taxonomy.js:
		- collections.artists — unique artist names from all posts' concerts.artist, and so on
	- Pagination templates generate the pages:
		- src/artist.liquid — paginates over collections.artists to create one page per artist
	- Each generated page:
		- Uses the permalink pattern to create URLs like /artist/diiv/ or /venue/arts-riot/
		- Lists all posts that match that artist or venue
	- This is a standard Eleventy pattern for taxonomy/archive pages: create a collection of unique values, then paginate over it to generate one page per value.
	

eleventyComputed.js
- This makes my front matter support multiple artists without mucking up the template with code


Future? 
"Is this about processing images?" → images.js (or keep in .eleventy.js if small)
